Cholesterol/HDL Ratio,Clinical High,Both,5,-,,,Fat Sugar Trim,"The Total Cholesterol/HDL Ratio simply compares the amount of Cholesterol to the amount of HDL (good cholesterol) and gives you a ratio or number. This ratio is a common way to determine your future risk of cardiovascular problems based on Cholesterol (or lipid) values. A higher ratio or number can mean an increased risk for cardiovascular problems, and a lower number can mean that you have a lower risk of cardiovascular problems."

"Cholesterol, Total",Clinical High,Both,200,-,,,Fat Sugar Trim,"This test measures the total level of Cholesterol in your body. Cholesterol circulates in your blood in different fractions or particles called lipoproteins, and these particles are usually referred to as HDL, LDL and VLDL. The sum total of HDL, LDL, and VLDL will equal your Total Cholesterol. Cholesterol is often communicated as a bad thing, and we are given the impression that we always need to get Cholesterol to a lower number to be healthy. The reality is that Cholesterol is needed to be healthy and it is essential for life. What many people don’t know is that in the original research on Cholesterol completed decades ago the researchers found that not only does high Cholesterol have a negative impact on health . . . mainly to your heart and cardiovascular system, but they also found that having low Cholesterol levels has its own unique set of consequences. Specifically, those people with low Cholesterol levels have an increased risk of developing cancer or other serious health problems over time. It will help you to understand some of the functions of cholesterol within your body. Cholesterol is part of the cell membrane (the outer layer of the cell) for all the cells in your body, so Cholesterol is necessary for healthy cells. About 60% of your brain is made up of fat and Cholesterol, so having enough Cholesterol is needed for a healthy brain and nervous system. Cholesterol is a precursor of what gets converted into many of the different hormones in your body . . . including the male and female hormones and adrenal hormones, so Cholesterol is needed for healthy hormone levels. Cholesterol is even a pretty good antioxidant . . . which means that it has the ability to protect your cells from getting damaged, and when your cells do get damaged Cholesterol can come to the rescue and help repair that cell damage. About 70% - 80% of the Cholesterol in your body is manufactured from within your own body . . . mostly by your liver. The remaining Cholesterol comes from your diet. So if Cholesterol is high it’s less likely due to dietary intake, and more likely because your liver is producing more Cholesterol because the body is sensing it needs more to improve the health of your cells, nervous system and hormones, or your body is in need of more antioxidants so your liver produces more Cholesterol for the antioxidant benefit it offers. It also means that if Cholesterol is too low it could indicate a person has an underactive or hypo-liver function since the liver produces the majority of cholesterol found in the body. The most reliable method for testing Cholesterol is after doing a 12 hour fasting . . . meaning there is no eating or drinking (except water) . . . for 12 hours prior to your blood draw. If the Cholesterol is high and a person did NOT do a proper 12 hour fasting . . . then this lab result is invalid and this should be re-tested if there are concerns about Cholesterol values. When the Total Cholesterol is in the Clinical Low range we will first consider if a person is on some type of Cholesterol lowering medication. If on a medication the patient may want to speak with their prescribing doctor to ask about reducing the dose or making some change to the medication . . . especially while making a serious effort to improve diet, lifestyle and using nutritional therapies to balance your body chemistry. Other factors that can contribute to a low Total Cholesterol include: 1) underactive or hypo-liver function or other problem affecting the liver, 2) overactive or hyper-thyroid function or a thyroid medication dose that is too high, 3) poor nutrition and/or very low fat intake, 4) a vegetarian or vegan diet, 5) poor absorption due to a digestive problem, or 6) overactive or hyper-adrenal function. It should be noted that a sudden drop in Total Cholesterol should alert one to some type of pathology or inflammatory condition, and this would be confirmed with other lab tests being out of range."
