      "description":"Testosterone, Free Your result for this lab test is in the CLINICAL LOW range. Testosterone is the main sex hormone in men, and it is responsible for male physical characteristics. Although it is considered to be a \"male\" sex hormone, it is present in the blood of both men and women. Testosterone is mainly produced by special endocrine tissue (the Leydig cells) in the male testicles. It is also produced by the adrenal glands in both men and women, and by the ovaries in small amounts in women. Testosterone levels are diurnal, peaking in the early morning hours (about 4:00 to 8:00 am), with the lowest levels in the evening (about 4:00 to 8:00 pm). Levels also increase after exercise and also decrease with age. Testosterone exists in your body in an active form called the “Free” form, and in an inactive form where Testosterone is not available for use by your body because it is bound to a protein. This lab test measures the total amount of Testosterone in ONLY the free or active form. When Free Testosterone is in the Clinical Low range we must determine why the internal production of Testosterone is low which could include: 1) damage or dysfunction of the testicles; 2) poor function of the adrenals which also produce a small amount of Testosterone; 3) poor function of the pituitary and hypothalamus which give direction to the testicles on their hormone production; 4) chemical, heavy metal or other toxicity in the body which can affect hormone production and function; 5) issues related to poor blood sugar control and diabetes; 6) alcoholism; 7) viral disease or infection; 8) some type of genetic disease or condition resulting in lower Testosterone production. There are also several nutritional elements when low or deficient in the body that can affect testosterone production."

An abnormal overproduction of Testosterone from within the body could include testicular tumors, adrenal tumors that are producing testosterone, or pituitary tumors that are causing an overproduction of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) which signal the testicles (in men) to produce Testosterone. A Functional High level of Testosterone is abnormal and should be evaluated by a qualified healthcare provider to determine the origin of the problem if the cause is unknown to the patient."

      "description":"Your result for this lab test is in the CLINICAL LOW range. Testosterone is the main sex hormone in men, and it is responsible for male physical characteristics. Although it is considered to be a \"male\" sex hormone, it is present in the blood of both men and women. Testosterone is mainly produced by special endocrine tissue (the Leydig cells) in the male testicles. It is also produced by the adrenal glands in both men and women, and by the ovaries in small amounts in women. Testosterone levels are diurnal, peaking in the early morning hours (about 4:00 to 8:00 am), with the lowest levels in the evening (about 4:00 to 8:00 pm). Levels also increase after exercise and also decrease with age. Testosterone exists in your body in an active form called the “Free” form, and in an inactive form where Testosterone is not available for use by your body because it is bound to a protein. This lab test measures the total amount of Testosterone in your body in BOTH the active and inactive forms. When Total Testosterone is in the Clinical Low range we must determine why the internal production of Testosterone is low which could include: 1) damage or dysfunction of the testicles; 2) poor function of the adrenals which also produce a small amount of Testosterone; 3) poor function of the pituitary and hypothalamus which give direction to the testicles on their hormone production; 4) chemical, heavy metal or other toxicity in the body which can affect hormone production and function; 5) issues related to poor blood sugar control and diabetes; 6) alcoholism; 7) viral disease or infection; 8) some type of genetic disease or condition resulting in lower Testosterone production. There are also several nutritional elements when low or deficient in the body that can affect testosterone production."

Cholesterol circulates in your blood in different fractions or particles called lipoproteins, and these particles are usually referred to as HDL, LDL and VLDL. The sum total of HDL, LDL, and VLDL will equal your Total Cholesterol. Cholesterol is often communicated as a bad thing, and we are given the impression that we always need to get Cholesterol to a lower number to be healthy. The reality is that Cholesterol is needed to be healthy and it is essential for life. What many people don’t know is that in the original research on Cholesterol completed decades ago the researchers found that not only does high Cholesterol have a negative impact on health . . . mainly to your heart and cardiovascular system, but they also found that having low Cholesterol levels has its own unique set of consequences. Specifically, those people with low Cholesterol levels have an increased risk of developing cancer or other serious health problems over time. It will help you to understand some of the functions of cholesterol within your body. Cholesterol is part of the cell membrane (the outer layer of the cell) for all the cells in your body, so Cholesterol is necessary for healthy cells. About 60% of your brain is made up of fat and Cholesterol, so having enough Cholesterol is needed for a healthy brain and nervous system. Cholesterol is a precursor of what gets converted into many of the different hormones in your body . . . including the male and female hormones and adrenal hormones, so Cholesterol is needed for healthy hormone levels. Cholesterol is even a pretty good antioxidant . . . which means that it has the ability to protect your cells from getting damaged, and when your cells do get damaged Cholesterol can come to the rescue and help repair that cell damage. About 70% - 80% of the Cholesterol in your body is manufactured from within your own body . . . mostly by your liver. The remaining Cholesterol comes from your diet. So if Cholesterol is high it’s less likely due to dietary intake, and more likely because your liver is producing more Cholesterol because the body is sensing it needs more to improve the health of your cells, nervous system and hormones, or your body is in need of more antioxidants so your liver produces more Cholesterol for the antioxidant benefit it offers. It also means that if Cholesterol is too low it could indicate a person has an underactive or hypo-liver function since the liver produces the majority of cholesterol found in the body. The most reliable method for testing Cholesterol is after doing a 12 hour fasting . . . meaning there is no eating or drinking (except water) . . . for 12 hours prior to your blood draw. If the Cholesterol is high and a person did NOT do a proper 12 hour fasting . . . then this lab result is invalid and this should be re-tested if there are concerns about Cholesterol values. When the Total Cholesterol is in the Clinical Low range we will first consider if a person is on some type of Cholesterol lowering medication. If on a medication the patient may want to speak with their prescribing doctor to ask about reducing the dose or making some change to the medication . . . especially while making a serious effort to improve diet, lifestyle and using nutritional therapies to balance your body chemistry. Other factors that can contribute to a low Total Cholesterol include: 1) underactive or hypo-liver function or other problem affecting the liver, 2) overactive or hyper-thyroid function or a thyroid medication dose that is too high, 3) poor nutrition and/or very low fat intake, 4) a vegetarian or vegan diet, 5) poor absorption due to a digestive problem, or 6) overactive or hyper-adrenal function. It should be noted that a sudden drop in Total Cholesterol should alert one to some type of pathology or inflammatory condition, and this would be confirmed with other lab tests being out of range."

      "description":"Your result for this lab test is in the FUNCTIONAL LOW range. This test measures the total level of Cholesterol in your body. Cholesterol circulates in your blood in different fractions or particles called lipoproteins, and these particles are usually referred to as HDL, LDL and VLDL. The sum total of HDL, LDL, and VLDL will equal your Total Cholesterol. Cholesterol is often communicated as a bad thing, and we are given the impression that we always need to get Cholesterol to a lower number to be healthy. The reality is that Cholesterol is needed to be healthy and it is essential for life. What many people don’t know is that in the original research on Cholesterol completed decades ago the researchers found that not only does high Cholesterol have a negative impact on health . . . mainly to your heart and cardiovascular system, but they also found that having low Cholesterol levels has its own unique set of consequences. Specifically, those people with low Cholesterol levels have an increased risk of developing cancer or other serious health problems over time. It will help you to understand some of the functions of cholesterol within your body. Cholesterol is part of the cell membrane (the outer layer of the cell) for all the cells in your body, so Cholesterol is necessary for healthy cells. About 60% of your brain is made up of fat and Cholesterol, so having enough Cholesterol is needed for a healthy brain and nervous system. Cholesterol is a precursor of what gets converted into many of the different hormones in your body . . . including the male and female hormones and adrenal hormones, so Cholesterol is needed for healthy hormone levels. Cholesterol is even a pretty good antioxidant . . . which means that it has the ability to protect your cells from getting damaged, and when your cells do get damaged Cholesterol can come to the rescue and help repair that cell damage. About 70% - 80% of the Cholesterol in your body is manufactured from within your own body . . . mostly by your liver. The remaining Cholesterol comes from your diet. So if Cholesterol is high it’s less likely due to dietary intake, and more likely because your liver is producing more Cholesterol because the body is sensing it needs more to improve the health of your cells, nervous system and hormones, or your body is in need of more antioxidants so your liver produces more Cholesterol for the antioxidant benefit it offers. It also means that if Cholesterol is too low it could indicate a person has an underactive or hypo-liver function since the liver produces the majority of cholesterol found in the body. The most reliable method for testing Cholesterol is after doing a 12 hour fasting . . . meaning there is no eating or drinking (except water) . . . for 12 hours prior to your blood draw. If the Cholesterol is high and a person did NOT do a proper 12 hour fasting . . . then this lab result is invalid and this should be re-tested if there are concerns about Cholesterol values. When the Total Cholesterol is in the Clinical Low range we will first consider if a person is on some type of Cholesterol lowering medication. If on a medication the patient may want to speak with their prescribing doctor to ask about reducing the dose or making some change to the medication . . . especially while making a serious effort to improve diet, lifestyle and using nutritional therapies to balance your body chemistry. Other factors that can contribute to a low Total Cholesterol include: 1) underactive or hypo-liver function or other problem affecting the liver, 2) overactive or hyper-thyroid function or a thyroid medication dose that is too high, 3) poor nutrition and/or very low fat intake, 4) a vegetarian or vegan diet, 5) poor absorption due to a digestive problem, or 6) overactive or hyper-adrenal function. It should be noted that a sudden drop in Total Cholesterol should alert one to some type of pathology or inflammatory condition, and this would be confirmed with other lab tests being out of range."

If Total Cholesterol is initially discovered to be in the 200 – 240 range . . . the goal for the first few months is usually to try a more conservative therapy by improving diet, exercise, and lifestyle factors and to also balance other aspects of body chemistry to see if this will bring Cholesterol closer to the Optimal range. If the Total Cholesterol is initially discovered to be over 240, or if a more conservative therapy of diet, exercise and lifestyle has not worked . . . then a more aggressive nutritional therapy may be recommended to target the high Total Cholesterol with the therapeutic goal of bringing this to a healthier level more quickly. Factors that can contribute to a high Total Cholesterol may include: 1) blood sugar issues and/or a diet high in sugars and carbohydrates, 2) underactive or hypo-thyroid function, 3) a problem affecting the liver, 4) underactive or hypo-adrenal function, and 5) a problem affecting the pancreas. It should be noted that some people have an elevated Total Cholesterol due to an allergy or sensitivity to eggs and their Cholesterol will be difficult to improve unless egg is removed from their diet."

In a respiratory problem the lungs are not able to remove Carbon Dioxide (CO2) gas from the blood as effectively, and CO2 begins to build-up in the blood. Carbon Dioxide as a blood gas is mainly an acid element, and the body will respond by producing more bicarbonate (which is really what is being measured in this blood test for Total Carbon Dioxide) to help reduce the acidity from this “respiratory acidosis”. A person may need to see a specialist and have blood gas testing done to determine if the Clinical High CO2 is due to a respiratory issue.<br><br>A metabolic problem leading to elevated Total Carbon Dioxide is most often indicating a more alkaline body chemistry from causes including: 1) a problem affecting the kidneys, 2) overactive or hyper-adrenal function, 3) blood sugar issues, 4) low stomach acid - especially if induce by excessive bicarbonate antacid intake, and 5) the effect of some medications."

Your liver has many important functions in the body including: removing chemicals and toxins from the body, it’s involved in blood sugar control, it activates the majority of thyroid hormone into its more bioactive form (T3) to improve energy and metabolism, and much more. Your liver is a very resilient organ, as you can have as little as 20% of good liver function and still have these liver enzymes test in the normal range. This means that when the AST begins to test outside the optimal range we want to take action more quickly to help improve function before any more damage happens to the liver or other affected tissues. When AST is in the Functional High range we first think of a problem affecting the liver.

This means that when the AST begins to test outside the optimal range we want to take action more quickly to help improve function before any more damage happens to the liver or other affected tissues. When AST is in the Functional High range we first think of a problem affecting the liver. The stress on the liver could be due to some type of infection or inflammation, a medication or other chemical stress, alcohol intake, or other reasons. Other reasons that may result in a high AST include: 1) some type of heart problem or coronary artery problem, 2) a gall bladder problem, 3) a pancreas problem, 4) a condition resulting in muscle tissue breakdown, 5) some types of anemia or 6) a recent viral infection."

This is the form of Vitamin D your body produces when your skin is exposed to sunlight. Care should be taken to let lab testing guide your daily dose of Vitamin D3 when taking it by supplement. Taking too much Vitamin D can become harmful if taken in excess for a longer period of time, and taking too small of a dose may have little to no benefit. Also, some people seem to improve and retain their Vitamin D levels better than others, so a recommended dose of Vitamin D3 can vary quite a bit from one person to another and should be determined based on the results of lab testing. Vitamin D in the Clinical High range is rare to see, and is most likely due to taking too high of a dose of Vitamin D by supplement."

A more comprehensive testing of thyroid function should be performed to have greater confidence that the thyroid gland is truly working at an optimal level . . . especially when a person is struggling with several symptoms of poor thyroid function. The thyroid has the nickname of the “great mimicker” because poor thyroid function can cause many symptoms and mimic many other health conditions. Some people go from one doctor to another trying to find out what is causing their symptoms . . . only to find out that their poor thyroid function is playing a major role in their health problems. Symptoms of underactive or hypo-thyroid function can include: fatigue, weight gain, soreness in muscles and joints, headaches, depression, constipation, slow metabolism, hair falling out, dry skin, intolerance to cold, menstrual changes in women, and more. Symptoms of overactive or hyper-thyroid function can include: sudden weight loss, anxiety and nervousness, rapid heartbeat, hands and fingers trembling, increased sweating, enlarged thyroid gland / swelling of the neck, difficulty sleeping, and more. Because poor thyroid function can affect many metabolic functions within the body, and can alter many lab results (not just the ones testing thyroid directly) . . . improving thyroid function becomes a higher \"priority\" when it’s discovered that it’s not functioning at an optimal level. When the TSH is in the Clinical High range this will indicate an underactive or hypo-thyroid function. It will help to compare this with other thyroid lab tests to confirm hypothyroidism. Many thyroid conditions involve an autoimmune reaction in which your immune system is attacking the thyroid gland or some aspect of thyroid function, so it will be helpful to also do thyroid antibody testing as this may change your dietary or therapeutic nutritional recommendations if your thyroid problems are in part due to an autoimmune condition. Other factors that can contribute to TSH in the Clinical High range may include: 1) a liver problem as the liver is highly involved in converting thyroid hormone into its most biologically active form called T3, 2) a pituitary problem as the pituitary produces TSH to control the thyroid gland, 3) a hypothalamus problem as the hypothalamus controls the pituitary and this is really the beginning of the hormonal communication within the body, 4) other hormone imbalance such as excess estrogen (estrogen dominance) affecting thyroid function, 5) chemicals or toxic heavy metals in the body disrupting thyroid function, 6) nutrient deficiencies such as iodine and selenium that can affect thyroid function, and 7) the effect of some medications - including taking a taking a thyroid medication dose that is too low for your body if on thyroid medication."

Changes in the RBC count usually mirror changes in other RBC tests, including the hematocrit and hemoglobin level. • If RBCs are lost or destroyed faster than they can be replaced, if bone marrow production is disrupted, or if the RBCs produced do not function normally, or do not contain enough hemoglobin, then you may develop anemia, which affects the amount of oxygen reaching tissues. •  If too many RBCs are produced and released, then you can develop polycythemia. This can cause thicker blood, decreased blood flow and related problems, such as headache, dizziness, problems with vision, and even excessive clotting or heart attack."

      "description":"Your result for this lab test is in the FUNCTIONAL HIGH range. Platelets are essential for normal blood clotting, and this test for Platelet Count is to determine the number of Platelets in your blood sample. Platelets help to stop bleeding by adhering to the location of blood vessel damage, by clumping together to form a “platelet plug”, and by releasing chemicals that help to stimulate more Platelets to clump together. Platelets are part of a complex series of events in the body that leads to proper clotting when a person is bleeding - called a coagulation cascade. Platelets are formed in the bone marrow and have a life-span of 8 - 10 days, so the bone marrow must be constantly creating new platelets to replace the old ones and to replace ones that are lost due to bleeding. When Platelets are in the Clinical Low range we will need to consider many conditions or situations that can contribute to lower than optimal Platelet Levels to include: 1) decreased production of Platelets by the bone marrow due to some type of disease or condition, 2) infection, 3) heavy metal toxicity, 4) several types of anemia, 5) an autoimmune condition in which the immune system is attacking the platelets, 6) a Vitamin B12 / Folic Acid deficiency, 7) Vitamin K deficiency, 8) several types of cancer - especially leukemia, or 9) the effect of some medications."

This lab test is a calculation to determine the actual or absolute number of Monocytes within a blood sample. When the total White Blood Cell count is elevated or decreased . . . looking at the absolute count of Monocytes can be helpful in determining what type infection or challenge to the immune system is taking place. Monocytes are produced in the bone marrow and then travel to tissues that are infected where they turn into a macrophage - a type of cell that consumes and removes infecting organisms, the fragments of damaged cells, and any other material left behind from an infection. It is typical to see Monocytes elevated in the final stages of an infection when the body is recovering from the infection. When Monocytes are in the Functional High range we will first consider if a person is recovering from some type of infection as it is typical for Monocytes to increase in the later stages of an infection to clean up the infected tissue. A more complete list of reasons why the Monocytes can be elevated include: 1) A bacterial or viral infection, 2) a parasite infection - often combined with elevated Eosinophils, 3) when a person has “Mono” referring to Mononucleosis caused by the Epstein-Barr virus - Mononucleosis simply refers to the presence of an abnormally large number of Monocytes in the blood, 4) an inflammatory process in the body, 5) a possible liver problem, and 6) a possible enlarged prostate in men over the age of 40 - often combined with increased Creatinine levels and increased LDH levels - specifically the LDH isoenzyme #4."

About 70% of iron in your body is incorporated into Hemoglobin inside your Red Blood Cells. The remainder is found in tissues in its storage form called Ferritin. When Serum Iron is in the Functional High range we must first determine if there is truly an excess of iron in the body by also looking at other iron-related lab tests. Factors that can contribute to iron excess in the body include: 1) excess intake from iron containing supplements, drinking water with high levels of iron and use of iron cookware, 2) a liver problem, 3) an inflammatory process within the body, or 4) poor conversion of iron into hemoglobin due to some other nutrient deficiency - such as B6, B12 or Folic Acid."

      "description":"Your result for this lab test is in the FUNCTIONAL LOW range. Iron Saturation is a measure of how much Transferrin is saturated with iron, and this is measured as a percentage. Transferrin is a carrier protein that helps to transport iron throughout the body. In a healthy individual the Iron Saturation ranges from about 20% - 40% . . . with and average around 33%. If there is not enough iron bound to this transport protein (called transferrin) then this protein is poorly saturated with iron and the Iron Saturation will be a lower percentage. This would indicate that there may not be enough iron in the body. Conversely, if this transport protein is highly saturated with iron . . . then the Iron Saturation will be at a higher percentage. This would indicate that there may be too much iron in the body. The measurement for Iron Saturation will usually travel in the same direction of iron levels in the body. If iron levels in the body are low, then the Iron Saturation will be a lower percentage. If iron levels in the body are high, then the Iron Saturation will be a higher percentage. When Iron Saturation is in the Functional Low range we must first determine if there is truly a deficiency of iron in the body by looking at other iron-related lab tests. Factors that can contribute to iron deficiency in the body include: 1) a lack of iron in the diet, 2) poor absorption of iron due to low stomach acid, 3) some type of bleeding within the body, 4) excessive menstrual bleeding for women, 5) a kidney problem, 6) a liver problem, 7) a need for Vitamin C which helps in the absorption of iron, or 8) an underactive or hypo-thyroid function."

      "description":"Your result for this lab test is in the CLINICAL LOW range. Here is a summary of the Function, Deficiency Symptoms and Repletion information for Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin). Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) Function: Vitamin B12 is needed to form blood and immune cells, and support a healthy nervous system. A series of closely-related compounds known collectively as cobalamins or vitamin B12 are converted into active forms methylcobalamin or 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin. Methylcobalamin interacts with folate metabolism, preventing folate derivatives from being trapped in unusable states. Adenosylcobalamin is involved in the metabolism of odd-chain fatty acids and branched-chain amino acids. Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) Deficiency Symptoms: Deficiency symptoms of vitamin B12 are both hematological (pernicious anemia) and neurological. A megaloblastic anemia may occur because the effects of the vitamin B12 deficiency on folate metabolism. Shortness of breath, fatigue, weakness, irritability, sore tongue, and a decrease in blood cell counts (red, white and platelets) are all clinical signs of a vitamin B12 deficiency. Neurological symptoms are manifested as a progressive neuropathy, with loss of position sense and ataxia. If vitamin B12 repletion is not initiated, permanent neurological damage, including degeneration of nerves and spinal cord can result. Recent evidence suggests that mental symptoms of depression and fatigue are detectable before anemia develops. Vitamin B12 is necessary to prevent accumulation of homocysteine, a toxic metabolic byproduct linked to cardiovascular disease and connective tissue abnormalities. Hypochlorhydria and gastrointestinal disturbances are frequently associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) Repletion information: Dietary sources for cobalamins are strictly from animal foodstuffs. Vitamin B12 is not found in plant foodstuffs. Dietary supplements can also contain vitamin B12. The 1989 RDA for vitamin B12 is 2.0 ?g for adults. No toxic effects of oral vitamin B12 intake have been demonstrated, even in doses over 1000 ?g daily. Some people may require more frequent or larger doses than usual before repletion occurs."
