   "description": "Your result for this lab test is in the CLINICAL HIGH range.  The Total Cholesterol/HDL Ratio simply compares the amount of Cholesterol to the amount of HDL (good cholesterol) and gives you a ratio or number. This ratio is a common way to determine your future risk of cardiovascular problems based on Cholesterol (or lipid) values. A higher ratio or number can mean an increased risk for cardiovascular problems, and a lower number can mean that you have a lower risk of cardiovascular problems."

   "description": "Your result for this lab test is in the CLINICAL HIGH range. This test measures the total level of Cholesterol in your body. Cholesterol circulates in your blood in different fractions or particles called lipoproteins, and these particles are usually referred to as HDL, LDL and VLDL. The sum total of HDL, LDL, and VLDL will equal your Total Cholesterol. Cholesterol is often communicated as a bad thing, and we are given the impression that we always need to get Cholesterol to a lower number to be healthy. The reality is that Cholesterol is needed to be healthy and it is essential for life. What many people don’t know is that in the original research on Cholesterol completed decades ago the researchers found that not only does high Cholesterol have a negative impact on health . . . mainly to your heart and cardiovascular system, but they also found that having low Cholesterol levels has its own unique set of consequences. Specifically, those people with low Cholesterol levels have an increased risk of developing cancer or other serious health problems over time. It will help you to understand some of the functions of cholesterol within your body. Cholesterol is part of the cell membrane (the outer layer of the cell) for all the cells in your body, so Cholesterol is necessary for healthy cells. About 60% of your brain is made up of fat and Cholesterol, so having enough Cholesterol is needed for a healthy brain and nervous system. Cholesterol is a precursor of what gets converted into many of the different hormones in your body . . . including the male and female hormones and adrenal hormones, so Cholesterol is needed for healthy hormone levels. Cholesterol is even a pretty good antioxidant . . . which means that it has the ability to protect your cells from getting damaged, and when your cells do get damaged Cholesterol can come to the rescue and help repair that cell damage. About 70% - 80% of the Cholesterol in your body is manufactured from within your own body . . . mostly by your liver. The remaining Cholesterol comes from your diet. So if Cholesterol is high it’s less likely due to dietary intake, and more likely because your liver is producing more Cholesterol because the body is sensing it needs more to improve the health of your cells, nervous system and hormones, or your body is in need of more antioxidants so your liver produces more Cholesterol for the antioxidant benefit it offers. It also means that if Cholesterol is too low it could indicate a person has an underactive or hypo-liver function since the liver produces the majority of cholesterol found in the body. The most reliable method for testing Cholesterol is after doing a 12 hour fasting . . . meaning there is no eating or drinking (except water) . . . for 12 hours prior to your blood draw. If the Cholesterol is high and a person did NOT do a proper 12 hour fasting . . . then this lab result is invalid and this should be re-tested if there are concerns about Cholesterol values. When Total Cholesterol is in the Clinical High range we will first compare this to other lab results such as Triglycerides, HDL, LDL and thyroid tests . . . as these tests can give a better understanding of why Cholesterol is elevated. If Total Cholesterol is over 300 we begin to think about family genetics, especially if it’s been at this level for many years. If Total Cholesterol is initially discovered to be in the 200 – 240 range . . . the goal for the first few months is usually to try a more conservative therapy by improving diet, exercise, and lifestyle factors and to also balance other aspects of body chemistry to see if this will bring Cholesterol closer to the Optimal range. If the Total Cholesterol is initially discovered to be over 240, or if a more conservative therapy of diet, exercise and lifestyle has not worked . . . then a more aggressive nutritional therapy may be recommended to target the high Total Cholesterol with the therapeutic goal of bringing this to a healthier level more quickly. Factors that can contribute to a high Total Cholesterol may include: 1) blood sugar issues and/or a diet high in sugars and carbohydrates, 2) underactive or hypo-thyroid function, 3) a problem affecting the liver, 4) underactive or hypo-adrenal function, and 5) a problem affecting the pancreas. It should be noted that some people have an elevated Total Cholesterol due to an allergy or sensitivity to eggs and their Cholesterol will be difficult to improve unless egg is removed from their diet."

Serum Iron is the most basic measure of iron status in your body, and like the name implies it measures the amount of iron that is currently available in your blood. Iron is transported in your blood with the help of a carrier protein called Transferrin. Serum Iron is specifically measuring the amount of Iron circulating in your blood while it is bound to Transferrin. Iron is absorbed into the body from the foods we eat, and requires good digestion. The carrier protein - called Transferrin - is produced by the Liver, so good iron levels can depend on good liver function. Iron is also an important component of Hemoglobin which is found in your Red Blood Cells, and Hemoglobin has the important job of transporting oxygen to all the cells of your body to keep your cells healthy and functioning their best. About 70% of iron in your body is incorporated into Hemoglobin inside your Red Blood Cells. The remainder is found in tissues in its storage form called Ferritin. When Serum Iron is in the Functional High range we must first determine if there is truly an excess of iron in the body by also looking at other iron-related lab tests. Factors that can contribute to iron excess in the body include: 1) excess intake from iron containing supplements, drinking water with high levels of iron and use of iron cookware, 2) a liver problem, 3) an inflammatory process within the body, or 4) poor conversion of iron into hemoglobin due to some other nutrient deficiency - such as B6, B12 or Folic Acid."

Your body uses iron to make hemoglobin, the protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout your body. If you don't have enough iron, you may not have enough hemoglobin. This condition is called iron deficiency anemia. Iron in your body is carried, or bound, mainly to a protein made by your liver called transferrin. The TIBC test is based on certain proteins, including transferrin, found in the blood. Your transferrin levels are almost always measured along with iron and TIBC. You may need these tests if your healthcare provider thinks your iron level is too low or too high. Not having enough iron in your diet is the most common cause of anemia and the most common type of diet deficiency in the U.S. Your healthcare provider may do this test to look at your diet, nutrition, liver, or other conditions that cause iron to be low, such as increased blood loss or pregnancy. Symptoms of iron deficiency include: •  Being tired and feeling weak •  Getting frequent infections • Feeling cold all the time • Having swelling in the tongue • Struggling to keep up at school or work • In children, having delayed mental development Symptoms of too much iron can include: • Feeling tired and weak •  Joint pain •  Belly pain."

However, calcium is involved in many other important functions of the body including muscle function, nervous system function, heart function, your immune system, blood clotting and the repair of damaged tissues, and more. Your ability to absorb calcium is highly dependent on having enough stomach acid (HCL) available during digestion, so low stomach acid can equal poor calcium absorption. Calcium levels in your blood are most greatly controlled by your parathyroid gland . . . which is a group of 4 small glands that sit on the backside of the thyroid gland (two on each side). Calcium levels are also strongly influenced by Vitamin D3 which helps improve the absorption of calcium from the intestines into the blood. Calcium travels in the blood in both a freely available ionized form, and in a non-available form that is bound to other proteins - most commonly albumin. This makes it important to also look at Serum Albumin levels when interpreting Serum Calcium levels. Please note that a low Serum Calcium does not automatically mean you are in need of additional calcium or that you are at risk for lower bone density, and is not a good method for tracking osteoporosis. Other factors should also be considered when interpreting Serum Calcium, such as magnesium levels, Vitamin D levels and how different hormones will influence calcium levels.<br><br>When Serum Calcium is in the Functional Low range this is indicating a possible need for increased calcium intake, but it could also indicate other factors such as: 1) a need for more Vitamin D3, 2) a need for other minerals like magnesium or phosphorus, 3) a need for more stomach acid (HCL) to improve the digestion and absorption of calcium, 4) underactive or hypo-parathyroid function, 5) a body chemistry that is too acidic, and 6) too little protein intake."

However, calcium is involved in many other important functions of the body including muscle function, nervous system function, heart function, your immune system, blood clotting and the repair of damaged tissues, and more. Your ability to absorb calcium is highly dependent on having enough stomach acid (HCL) available during digestion, so low stomach acid can equal poor calcium absorption. Calcium levels in your blood are most greatly controlled by your parathyroid gland . . . which is a group of 4 small glands that sit on the backside of the thyroid gland (two on each side). Calcium levels are also strongly influenced by Vitamin D which helps improve the absorption of calcium from the intestines into the blood. Calcium travels in the blood in both a freely available ionized form, and in a non-available form that is bound to other proteins - most commonly albumin. This makes it important to also look at Serum Albumin levels when interpreting Serum Calcium levels. Please note that a low Serum Calcium does not automatically mean you are in need of additional calcium or that you are at risk for lower bone density, and is not a good method for tracking osteoporosis. Other factors should also be considered when interpreting Serum Calcium, such as magnesium levels, Vitamin D levels and how different hormones will influence calcium levels.<br><br>When Serum Calcium levels are HIGHER than optimal we must consider if a person is taking too much Vitamin D in supplement form. Sometimes those people on thyroid medications can have slightly elevated calcium levels. Calcium levels in the blood are very carefully controlled by the body, so if blood testing reveals Serum Calcium to be at very high levels then this indicates some other problem in the body - possible with the parathyroid gland - and this person will likely need to go to a specialist for more testing. When Serum Calcium levels are LOWER than optimal we know that this could be due to several factors, but it is safe to conclude that the body may be in need of more calcium."

Cholesterol circulates in your blood in different fractions or particles called lipoproteins, and these particles are usually referred to as HDL, LDL and VLDL. The sum total of HDL, LDL, and VLDL will equal your Total Cholesterol. Cholesterol is often communicated as a bad thing, and we are given the impression that we always need to get Cholesterol to a lower number to be healthy. The reality is that Cholesterol is needed to be healthy and it is essential for life. What many people don’t know is that in the original research on Cholesterol completed decades ago the researchers found that not only does high Cholesterol have a negative impact on health . . . mainly to your heart and cardiovascular system, but they also found that having low Cholesterol levels has its own unique set of consequences. Specifically, those people with low Cholesterol levels have an increased risk of developing cancer or other serious health problems over time. It will help you to understand some of the functions of cholesterol within your body. Cholesterol is part of the cell membrane (the outer layer of the cell) for all the cells in your body, so Cholesterol is necessary for healthy cells. About 60% of your brain is made up of fat and Cholesterol, so having enough Cholesterol is needed for a healthy brain and nervous system. Cholesterol is a precursor of what gets converted into many of the different hormones in your body . . . including the male and female hormones and adrenal hormones, so Cholesterol is needed for healthy hormone levels. Cholesterol is even a pretty good antioxidant . . . which means that it has the ability to protect your cells from getting damaged, and when your cells do get damaged Cholesterol can come to the rescue and help repair that cell damage. About 70% - 80% of the Cholesterol in your body is manufactured from within your own body . . . mostly by your liver. The remaining Cholesterol comes from your diet. So if Cholesterol is high it’s less likely due to dietary intake, and more likely because your liver is producing more Cholesterol because the body is sensing it needs more to improve the health of your cells, nervous system and hormones, or your body is in need of more antioxidants so your liver produces more Cholesterol for the antioxidant benefit it offers. It also means that if Cholesterol is too low it could indicate a person has an underactive or hypo- liver function since the liver produces the majority of cholesterol found in the body. The most reliable method for testing Cholesterol is after doing a 12 hour fasting . . . meaning there is no eating or drinking (except water) . . . for 12 hours prior to your blood draw. If the Cholesterol is high and a person did NOT do a proper 12 hour fasting . . . then this lab result is invalid and this should be re-tested if there are concerns about Cholesterol values. When the Total Cholesterol is in the Functional Low range we will first consider if a person is on some type of Cholesterol lowering medication. If on a medication the patient may want to speak with their prescribing doctor to ask about reducing the dose or making some change to the medication . . . especially while making a serious effort to improve diet, lifestyle and using nutritional therapies to balance your body chemistry. Other factors that can contribute to a low Total Cholesterol include: 1) underactive or hypo-liver function or other problem affecting the liver, 2) overactive or hyper-thyroid function or a thyroid medication dose that is too high, 3) poor nutrition and/or very low fat intake, 4) a vegetarian or vegan diet, 5) poor absorption due to a digestive problem, or 6) overactive or hyper-adrenal function. It should be noted that a sudden drop in Total Cholesterol should alert one to some type of pathology or inflammatory condition, and this would be confirmed with other lab tests being out of range"

   "description": "Your result for this lab test is in the FUNCTIONAL HIGH range. Here is a summary of the Function, Deficiency Symptoms and Repletion information for Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin). Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) Function: Vitamin B12 is needed to form blood and immune cells, and support a healthy nervous system. A series of closely-related compounds known collectively as cobalamins or vitamin B12 are converted into active forms methylcobalamin or 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin. Methylcobalamin interacts with folate metabolism, preventing folate derivatives from being trapped in unusable states. Adenosylcobalamin is involved in the metabolism of odd-chain fatty acids and branched-chain amino acids. Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) Deficiency Symptoms: Deficiency symptoms of vitamin B12 are both hematological (pernicious anemia) and neurological. A megaloblastic anemia may occur because the effects of the vitamin B12 deficiency on folate metabolism. Shortness of breath, fatigue, weakness, irritability, sore tongue, and a decrease in blood cell counts (red, white and platelets) are all clinical signs of a vitamin B12 deficiency. Neurological symptoms are manifested as a progressive neuropathy, with loss of position sense and ataxia. If vitamin B12 repletion is not initiated, permanent neurological damage, including degeneration of nerves and spinal cord can result. Recent evidence suggests that mental symptoms of depression and fatigue are detectable before anemia develops. Vitamin B12 is necessary to prevent accumulation of homocysteine, a toxic metabolic byproduct linked to cardiovascular disease and connective tissue abnormalities. Hypochlorhydria and gastrointestinal disturbances are frequently associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) Repletion information: Dietary sources for cobalamins are strictly from animal foodstuffs. Vitamin B12 is not found in plant foodstuffs. Dietary supplements can also contain vitamin B12. The 1989 RDA for vitamin B12 is 2.0 ?g for adults. No toxic effects of oral vitamin B12 intake have been demonstrated, even in doses over 1000 ?g daily. Some people may require more frequent or larger doses than usual before repletion occurs."

When these factors have been ruled out, we then look at more common functional reasons such as: 1) a person being dehydrated at the time of blood draw, 2) poor adrenal gland function, 3) poor control of blood sugar and insulin levels - such as diabetes, 4) some type of cell or tissue destruction within the body - since most potassium is located within the cell, 5) and higher than optimal potassium can be a good indicator that the body chemistry has become too acidic."

   "description": "Your result for this lab test is in the CLINICAL LOW range. Vitamin D is one of the most heavily research of all the individual vitamins and minerals for many years. Although it is referred to as a vitamin . . . the active form of Vitamin D functions in many ways like a hormone in the way it communicates and controls the function of your cells. The benefits of Vitamin D include: 1) improving blood sugar control because your pancreas needs Vitamin D in the manufacture of insulin, 2) improving the balance of brain chemistry, 3) improving the balance of female and male hormones, 4) improving energy levels - some people have noticed an increase in energy after taking the proper therapeutic dose of Vitamin D3 based on the results of lab testing, 5) improved immune function - fewer colds and flu, 6) improving bone density by helping to bring digested calcium into the blood so it can then be incorporated into bone tissue, and 7) the ability to reduce an auto-immune reaction within the body. One of the most important benefits of Vitamin D is the cancer-protective effect it has on your cells. Vitamin D helps to prevent the proliferation (or abnormal growth) of cells within your body . . . and this is really what most cancers are . . . cells that are growing in an abnormal and uncontrolled way. The effect of Vitamin D to help suppress the growth of abnormal cells is powerful enough to make this an important consideration in cancer prevention, and in making your cells healthy again once cancer has become establish within the body. Vitamin D3 is the active or bioavailable form of Vitamin D, and is the preferred form when taken as a supplement. This is the form of Vitamin D your body produces when your skin is exposed to sunlight. Care should be taken to let lab testing guide your daily dose of Vitamin D3 when taking it by supplement. Taking too much Vitamin D can become harmful if taken in excess for a longer period of time, and taking too small of a dose may have little to no benefit. Also, some people seem to improve and retain their Vitamin D levels better than others, so a recommended dose of Vitamin D3 can vary quite a bit from one person to another and should be determined based on the results of lab testing for Vitamin D. When Vitamin D is in the Clinical Low range this usually means that a person is not receiving enough sunlight exposure to their skin, or they are not getting enough through foods that are fortified with Vitamin D. Since the cancer protective and many other health benefits of Vitamin D are realized when it is in the Optimal range . . . taking Vitamin D3 in supplement form would be appropriate to increase your levels. Follow-up lab testing of Vitamin D is recommended to make sure levels have improved, and to make sure your Vitamin D levels have not gone too high."

C-Reactive Protein is produced by the liver and it is released into the bloodstream with inflammation, infection and injury of tissues. It is most often used as a measure of inflammation within the body that tends to be more recent or more acute. The “Cardiac” portion of this lab test name refers the High Sensitivity version of this lab test. This means we are trying to detect smaller levels of this protein due to inflammation which has also been shown to be a risk factor for cardiovascular problems, and its ability to predict the risk of a future cardiovascular event such as heart attack and stroke. However, the inflammation may be located anywhere in the body and is not specific to only the cardiovascular system. Inflammation has the nickname of the “silent killer” because inflammation often precedes many of the chronic diseases that people suffer with when they get older. Identifying inflammation now and getting it under control could very well help to prevent a health problem later in life, or at the very least help to reduce the severity of a future health problem."

   "description": "Your result for this lab test is in the CLINICAL HIGH range. Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the body, and the majority of the calcium in your body is stored in your bone tissue. Therefore, most people will associate calcium with bone density and preventing osteoporosis. However, calcium is involved in many other important functions of the body including muscle function, nervous system function, heart function, your immune system, blood clotting and the repair of damaged tissues, and more. Your ability to absorb calcium is highly dependent on having enough stomach acid (HCL) available during digestion, so low stomach acid can equal poor calcium absorption. Calcium levels in your blood are most greatly controlled by your parathyroid gland . . . which is a group of 4 small glands that sit on the backside of the thyroid gland (two on each side). Calcium levels are also strongly influenced by Vitamin D which helps improve the absorption of calcium from the intestines into the blood. Calcium travels in the blood in both a freely available ionized form, and in a non-available form that is bound to other proteins - most commonly albumin. This makes it important to also look at Serum Albumin levels when interpreting Serum Calcium levels. Please note that a low Serum Calcium does not automatically mean you are in need of additional calcium or that you are at risk for lower bone density, and is not a good method for tracking osteoporosis. Other factors should also be considered when interpreting Serum Calcium, such as magnesium levels, Vitamin D levels and how different hormones will influence calcium levels.<br><br>When Serum Calcium is significantly elevated in the Clinical High range we must first consider a problem with the parathyroid gland. An increase in parathyroid hormone in the blood will also greatly increase the amount of calcium in the blood. A person with a highly elevated Serum Calcium will likely need more testing or to see a specialist (such as an endocrinologist) to determine the presence of a parathyroid problem. An overactive parathyroid gland resulting in a highly elevated Serum Calcium can have many health consequences.<br><br>It will be more common to see Serum Calcium only slight elevated into the Clinical High range, and we must first consider if there is a thyroid problem. It is somewhat common to see a slightly elevated Serum Calcium when a person has an overactive thyroid gland - called hyperthyroidism, or if they are taking thyroid medication dose that is too high for their body. This should first be correlated with the thyroid lab testing to determine if there is a thyroid problem, or it their thyroid medication dose is appropriate. Slightly elevated calcium could also be due to: 1) Excessive Vitamin D intake, 2) destruction of cells releasing Calcium into the serum, 3) underactive or hypo-adrenal function, or 4) other hormone problem."

   "description": "Your result for this lab test is in the FUNCTIONAL LOW range. This test measures the total level of Triglycerides in your body. A Triglyceride is a substance that has sugar and fat combined together. The sugar and fatty acid portions of a Triglyceride are part of what your cells use as a fuel source for the energy they need to function. Triglycerides also get incorporated into your fat cells and become part of your storage of body fat. Abnormal Triglyceride levels will often reflect dietary intake of fat and carbohydrates, as well as poor blood sugar control, and can have a significant impact on cardiovascular health. The most reliable method for testing Triglycerides is after doing a 12 hour fasting . . . meaning there is no eating or drinking (except water) . . . for 12 hours prior to your blood draw. If Triglycerides are high and a person did NOT do a proper 12 hour fasting . . . then this lab result is invalid and this should be re-tested if there are concerns about Triglyceride levels. When Triglycerides are in the Functional Low range there are several factors to consider including: 1) underactive or hypo-liver function or other problem affecting the liver, 2) overactive or hyper-thyroid function or a thyroid medication dose that is too high, 3) poor nutrition and/or very low fat intake, 4) vegetarian or vegan diet, 5) poor absorption due to a digestive problem, 6) overactive or hyper-adrenal function, 7) a possible autoimmune condition - especially when seen with a high HDL at >80, and 8) the effect of some medications."

Magnesium is involved in hundreds of chemical and enzyme reactions within the body, and it’s one of the most common mineral deficiencies. Magnesium is needed for many functions in the body to include: energy production, sugar metabolism, hormone balance, balance of brain chemistry, memory, heart function, and most notably for proper muscle function. About half of your magnesium is found within the soft tissues and muscles of your body, and the rest is in bone tissue. Your body needs enough magnesium for your muscles to relax properly. People who suffer with chronic muscle tightness, or even muscle cramps – such as “charlie horses” in the foot or calf muscles waking a person up from their sleep at night – are often symptoms of a magnesium deficiency. Magnesium not only affects the function of the skeletal muscles (the muscles that allow you to move your body), but it also affects the muscles that control your blood vessels. You have small muscles in your blood vessels that control how dilated (open) or contracted (closed) your blood vessels are. A magnesium deficiency could lead to tighter muscles in your blood vessels and result in them being more contracted (closed) and therefore higher blood pressure. Considering how common magnesium deficiency in our society is, this is likely to be one of many factors that contribute to High Blood Pressure. Taking magnesium may result in a decrease of chronically High Blood Pressure."

Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) Function: Vitamin B12 is needed to form blood and immune cells, and support a healthy nervous system. A series of closely-related compounds known collectively as cobalamins or vitamin B12 are converted into active forms methylcobalamin or 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin. Methylcobalamin interacts with folate metabolism, preventing folate derivatives from being trapped in unusable states. Adenosylcobalamin is involved in the metabolism of odd-chain fatty acids and branched-chain amino acids. Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) Deficiency Symptoms: Deficiency symptoms of vitamin B12 are both hematological (pernicious anemia) and neurological. A megaloblastic anemia may occur because the effects of the vitamin B12 deficiency on folate metabolism. Shortness of breath, fatigue, weakness, irritability, sore tongue, and a decrease in blood cell counts (red, white and platelets) are all clinical signs of a vitamin B12 deficiency. Neurological symptoms are manifested as a progressive neuropathy, with loss of position sense and ataxia. If vitamin B12 repletion is not initiated, permanent neurological damage, including degeneration of nerves and spinal cord can result. Recent evidence suggests that mental symptoms of depression and fatigue are detectable before anemia develops. Vitamin B12 is necessary to prevent accumulation of homocysteine, a toxic metabolic byproduct linked to cardiovascular disease and connective tissue abnormalities. Hypochlorhydria and gastrointestinal disturbances are frequently associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) Repletion information: Dietary sources for cobalamins are strictly from animal foodstuffs. Vitamin B12 is not found in plant foodstuffs. Dietary supplements can also contain vitamin B12. The 1989 RDA for vitamin B12 is 2.0 ?g for adults. No toxic effects of oral vitamin B12 intake have been demonstrated, even in doses over 1000 ?g daily. Some people may require more frequent or larger doses than usual before repletion occurs."

   "description": "Your result for this lab test is in the CLINICAL HIGH range. Testosterone is the main sex hormone in men, and it is responsible for male physical characteristics. Although it is considered to be a \"male\" sex hormone, it is present in the blood of both men and women. Testosterone is mainly produced by special endocrine tissue (the Leydig cells) in the male testicles.

Levels also increase after exercise and also decrease with age. Testosterone exists in your body in an active form called the “Free” form, and in an inactive form where Testosterone is not available for use by your body because it is bound to a protein. This lab test measures the total amount of Testosterone in your body in BOTH the active and inactive forms.<br><br>When Total Testosterone is in the Clinical High range we must first determine if this is due to an overexposure to the hormone from an external source, or from an overproduction of the hormone inside the body. Exposure to Testosterone from an external source could include: 1) someone who is on a Testosterone hormone therapy as prescribed by a medical provider; 2) being in close physical contact with someone who is using a Testosterone lotion, gel or cream as part of a prescribed hormone therapy resulting in the hormone being absorbed into the skin of a second individual unintentionally; 3) the intentional intake of Testosterone as a steroid hormone for muscle building, performance enhancement, or other reasons. An abnormal overproduction of Testosterone from within the body could include testicular tumors, adrenal tumors that are producing testosterone, or pituitary tumors that are causing an overproduction of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) which signal the testicles (in men) to produce Testosterone. A Clinical High level of Testosterone is abnormal and should be evaluated by a qualified healthcare provider to determine the origin of the problem if the cause is unknown to the patient."

Hematocrit is simply measuring the percentage of your blood that is only Red Blood Cells, and reflects both the number of Red Blood Cells and the size or volume of the Red Blood Cells - with the size or volume measured as MCV (mean corpuscular volume) in blood testing. Understand that your blood is made up of both liquid and solid particles. The liquid is referred to as plasma, and the solid particles are things like Red Blood Cells, White Blood Cells, Platelets, and more. Hematocrit is telling us what percentage of a blood sample is purely Red Blood Cells. Hematocrit will usually travel in the same direction of the RBC count, unless the individual Red Blood Cells are smaller or larger than normal in size or volume.<br><br>When Hematocrit is in the Clinical High range we will first need to remember that anything that causes the Red Blood Cell count to increase will usually result in an increase of Hematocrit as well. The reasons for high Hematocrit can include: 1) dehydration due to poor water intake or more frequent vomiting or diarrhea, 2) not enough oxygen getting into the body because of a respiratory (lung) condition, heart condition, living at high altitudes where there is less oxygen in the air, frequent smoking, and sleep apnea, 3) vitamin B6 deficiency, 5) overactive or hyper-adrenal function, 6) the effect of some medications, 7) the excess production of a hormone called erythropoietin - a hormone produced by the kidneys that stimulates the stem cells in the bone marrow to make more red blood cells - excess production of this hormone is most likely due to a kidney tumor."

Hemoglobin is a protein that contains iron, and this is what gives your blood its red color. Hemoglobin is an important part of your Red Blood Cells that allows you to pick-up oxygen from your lungs and transports that oxygen to all the cells of your body. It also helps transport carbon dioxide from your cells back to the lungs to be removed from your body when you exhale during breathing. When Hemoglobin is in the Functional Low range we will first need to remember that anything that causes the Red Blood Cell count to decrease will result in a decrease of Hemoglobin within the blood. With Hemoglobin in the Functional Low range we will consider that person as having an “anemic tendency” or pre-anemic. Meaning they do not necessarily meet the clinical definition of Anemia, but because their Hemoglobin is lower than optimal they may be moving in the direction of becoming anemic. As Hemoglobin is moving closer to the clinical low range we will consider the many reasons for lower than optimal Hemoglobin more seriously to include: 1) a deficiency of one or more nutrients that are critical for healthy Red Blood Cells such as Iron, Vitamin B12, Vitamin B6, Folic Acid, Vitamin C and the mineral Copper, 2) a loss of blood due to bleeding from some type of trauma or injury, a bleeding processing within the digestive system such as an ulcer or colon cancer, a severe bladder or kidney infection resulting in blood loss through the urine, or heavy menstrual bleeding in women, 3) the Red Blood Cells are getting destroyed due to some type of auto-immune condition or other disease process, 4) a possible liver or kidney problem, 5) the effect of some medications. If Hemoglobin continues to decline on follow-up lab testing then we may need to consult with a blood specialist in order to determine the cause of Anemia."

   "description": "Potassium, Serum Your result for this lab test is in the CLINICAL LOW range. Potassium is an electrolyte that is critical to cell metabolism and muscle function . . . including the proper function of your heart muscle. Potassium also helps to regulate the amount of fluid in your body, and helps in maintaining an acid-alkaline balance within your body. Most of the potassium in your body is located inside of your cells, but we still measure potassium levels outside of your cells (in the serum) because even small changes in serum potassium can have big consequences to how your cells are functioning. Potassium is mostly regulated in your body by your kidneys and can serve as another indicator of kidney function, but potassium is also strongly influenced by adrenal hormone function and certain medications - such as diuretics. When potassium levels are in the Clinical Low range it is not often due to poor dietary intake of potassium. We must first rule out a medication that is increasing potassium loss such as steroid medications, antibiotics and potassium-wasting diuretics (commonly called “water pills”). We then look at more common functional reasons such as: 1) digestive problems that result in diarrhea and vomiting, 2) poor adrenal gland function, 3) poor control of blood sugar and insulin - such as diabetes, 4) and lower than optimal potassium can be a good indicator the body chemistry has become too alkaline."

Also be aware that falsely elevated potassium can result from poor handling of the blood sample, allowing it to sit too long before analysis, and a person clenching or pumping their fist too much at the time of blood draw.

However, the inflammation may be located anywhere in the body and is not specific to only the cardiovascular system. Inflammation has the nickname of the “silent killer” because inflammation often precedes many of the chronic diseases that people suffer with when they get older.

   "description": "Your result for this lab test is in the CLINICAL LOW range. Globulin is a term for all proteins in the blood that are not Albumin. Globulins are another type of “carrier protein” involved in the transport of some resources to your cells to help them function at their best. There are 4 fractions (or types) of Globulins in the blood that make up your number for Total Globulin. These 4 fractions are called: Alpha 1, Alpha 2, Beta and Gamma. Globulins are also an important part of your immune system and are critical in the formation of antibodies - also called immunoglobulins such as IgA, IgE, IgG and IgM - which are manufactured from the gamma fraction. The gamma fraction usually makes up the largest portion of the Total Globulin, so an abnormal Total Globulin would have us first thinking about some type of acute or chronic challenge to the immune system . . . but may be due to other factors as well. When Total Globulin is close to or within the Clinical High or Clinical Low ranges, an additional test called a serum protein electrophoresis should be considered to determine which fraction(s) are involved to allow for a better diagnosis.<br><br>When Total Globulin is in the Clinical Low range we must first consider an immune system that has been worn down due to some type of chronic infection or other immune challenge. Other factors that may contribute to a low Total Globulin include: 1) an inflammatory problem, 2) a liver problem, or 3) anemia."

   "description": "Your result for this lab test is in the CLINICAL HIGH range. TSH refers to Thyroid Stimulating Hormone and it is with this hormone that the brain (or more specifically a part of the brain called the pituitary) is able to control the thyroid gland and the production of thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone plays a major role in controlling your metabolism and energy production. If the brain senses too little thyroid hormone in the body then TSH will increase to tell the thyroid to produce more hormone. If the brain senses there is too much thyroid hormone in the body then TSH will decrease as a way of telling the thyroid to produce less hormone. TSH is the most common lab test performed by doctors to measure thyroid function. However, too many health providers rely on this test as the only measure of thyroid function, and this can be very misleading. The TSH lab result can be in the labs normal range and a person can still have altered thyroid function as determined by other thyroid lab tests. This overreliance on TSH as a primary indicator of thyroid function has resulted in millions of people not getting properly diagnosed with a real thyroid problem. A more comprehensive testing of thyroid function should be performed to have greater confidence that the thyroid gland is truly working at an optimal level . . . especially when a person is struggling with several symptoms of poor thyroid function. The thyroid has the nickname of the “great mimicker” because poor thyroid function can cause many symptoms and mimic many other health conditions. Some people go from one doctor to another trying to find out what is causing their symptoms . . . only to find out that their poor thyroid function is playing a major role in their health problems. Symptoms of underactive or hypo-thyroid function can include: fatigue, weight gain, soreness in muscles and joints, headaches, depression, constipation, slow metabolism, hair falling out, dry skin, intolerance to cold, menstrual changes in women, and more. Symptoms of overactive or hyper-thyroid function can include: sudden weight loss, anxiety and nervousness, rapid heartbeat, hands and fingers trembling, increased sweating, enlarged thyroid gland / swelling of the neck, difficulty sleeping, and more. Because poor thyroid function can affect many metabolic functions within the body, and can alter many lab results (not just the ones testing thyroid directly) . . . improving thyroid function becomes a higher \"priority\" when it’s discovered that it’s not functioning at an optimal level. When the TSH is in the Clinical High range this will indicate an underactive or hypo-thyroid function. It will help to compare this with other thyroid lab tests to confirm hypothyroidism. Many thyroid conditions involve an autoimmune reaction in which your immune system is attacking the thyroid gland or some aspect of thyroid function, so it will be helpful to also do thyroid antibody testing as this may change your dietary or therapeutic nutritional recommendations if your thyroid problems are in part due to an autoimmune condition. Other factors that can contribute to TSH in the Clinical High range may include: 1) a liver problem as the liver is highly involved in converting thyroid hormone into its most biologically active form called T3, 2) a pituitary problem as the pituitary produces TSH to control the thyroid gland, 3) a hypothalamus problem as the hypothalamus controls the pituitary and this is really the beginning of the hormonal communication within the body, 4) other hormone imbalance such as excess estrogen (estrogen dominance) affecting thyroid function, 5) chemicals or toxic heavy metals in the body disrupting thyroid function, 6) nutrient deficiencies such as iodine and selenium that can affect thyroid function, and 7) the effect of some medications - including taking a taking a thyroid medication dose that is too low for your body if on thyroid medication."

A clinical diagnosis of Gout is a condition where Uric Acid levels are in the Clinical High range, and the Uric Acid can buildup and form small crystals in the joints and tissues of the body and cause inflammation and severe pain. A classic presentation of Gout usually affects only one or a few joints in the body, and will often settle in the big toe of the foot causing inflammation and severe pain. "

   "description": "Your result for this test is in the Functional High range. Uric Acid is created in the body as a by- product of protein metabolism, or increased destruction of cells within your body. Uric Acid is removed from the body mostly by your kidneys, and this makes Uric Acid an indicator of how your kidneys are functioning. High Uric Acid can also be a strong indicator of possible inflammation within your body. When the Uric Acid is in the Functional High range it will often be associated with a condition called Psuedo-Gout. What many people don’t know is that you can have only moderately high Uric Acid levels in blood testing – meaning they are in the Functional High range – and have a condition called pseudo-gout. Pseudo-gout can result in pain, inflammation, stiffness and achiness of muscles and joints that are more generalized throughout the body, sometimes being confused with arthritis or other inflammatory conditions. Some common reasons for increased Uric Acid are: 1) blood sugar issues and consuming too much sugar and highly processed carbohydrates, 2) overconsumption of meats, organ meats, shellfish and legumes, 3) overconsumption of alcohol, 4) overconsumption of fried, fatty, processed and hydrogenated foods and 5) certain drugs or medications can result in high Uric Acid. A final consideration is when Uric Acid levels are high along with other abnormal kidney function lab tests . . . you may then want to consult with a specialist to rule out kidney disease. Dietary changes can be an important part of reducing high Uric Acid levels for some people."

Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) is the total amount of cholesterol contained in lipoproteins other than high-density lipoprotein (HDL). HDL is a particle that contains cholesterol, which is called HDL cholesterol or HDL-C. Non-HDL-C is calculated from the results of a lipid profile by subtracting the HDL-C result from the total cholesterol. Lipoproteins are responsible for the transport and metabolism of cholesterol. Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) transport cholesterol from the liver to other tissues, including blood vessel walls. Therefore, high LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) is considered to be associated with the development of hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). High density lipoproteins (HDL) have an inverse function - they transport cholesterol from the blood vessels to the liver, thus providing protection against CVD. Monitoring and maintaining healthy levels of lipids is important for staying healthy. Eating too much of foods that are high in saturated fats and trans unsaturated fats (trans fats) or having an inherited predisposition can result in a high level of cholesterol in the blood. The extra cholesterol may be deposited in plaques on the walls of blood vessels. Plaques can narrow or eventually block the opening of blood vessels, leading to atherosclerosis and increased risk of numerous health problems, including heart disease and stroke. Additionally, rupture of plaque can cause a heart attack. In the standard lipid profile, the level of total cholesterol and HDL-C are measured. LDL-C is usually not measured directly but is calculated from the results of the other components of the lipid profile, including total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides. Non-HDL-C may be reported as part of the lipid profile. It reflects the amount of cholesterol in all fractions of lipoproteins that may contribute to your risk of heart disease (atherogenic): LDL, intermediate and very low density lipoproteins (IDL, VLDL) and lipoprotein a (Lp (a))."

RBCs also help transport a small portion of carbon dioxide, a waste product of cell metabolism, from those tissues and organs back to the lungs, where it is expelled. The typical lifespan of an RBC is 120 days. Thus the bone marrow must continually produce new RBCs to replace those that age and degrade or are lost through bleeding. A number of conditions can affect RBC production and some conditions may result in significant bleeding. Other disorders may affect the lifespan of RBCs in circulation, especially if the RBCs are deformed due to an inherited or acquired defect or abnormality. These conditions may lead to a rise or drop in the RBC count. Changes in the RBC count usually mirror changes in other RBC tests, including the hematocrit and hemoglobin level. • If RBCs are lost or destroyed faster than they can be replaced, if bone marrow production is disrupted, or if the RBCs produced do not function normally, or do not contain enough hemoglobin, then you may develop anemia, which affects the amount of oxygen reaching tissues. •  If too many RBCs are produced and released, then you can develop polycythemia.

In order for Cholesterol to travel through your bloodstream it needs to be carried and transported by a particle called a lipoprotein, and HDL is one of these lipoprotein particles. You will often hear of this as the “good cholesterol”, because these HDL particles have the ability to clean out deposits that can build-up in your arteries and HDL may prevent the build-up of plaque that can damage your blood vessels. Having your HDL levels high enough will help to protect and improve the health of your blood vessels and can be a positive factor in preventing cardiovascular problems including heart attack and stroke. The best ways we know of to naturally improve or maintain healthy levels of HDL is through regular exercise, consuming enough Omega 3 Essential Fatty Acids (EFA), maintaining healthy blood sugar levels, and keeping your body at a healthy weight. When HDL Cholesterol is in the Clinical Low range there are several factors to consider to include: 1) Omega 3 EFA deficiency, 2) blood sugar issues or insulin resistance, 3) a problem affecting the liver, 4) a diet that is too high in sugar and carbohydrates, 5) overactive or hyper-thyroid function, 6) a lifestyle that is too sedentary / too little exercise, and 7) the effect of some medications."

Creatinine is found within muscle tissue and is released into the blood stream during muscle contraction or breakdown of muscle tissue. Since almost all Creatinine is removed by the kidneys . . . testing blood levels of Creatinine is a good measure of how well the kidneys are working. Creatinine is also relative to the amount of muscle on the body, so a person with higher muscle mass will have slightly higher Creatinine levels and a person with low muscle mass will have slightly lower levels. Creatinine is derived from Creatine which is used as a source of energy in muscle contraction and is produced mostly within in the liver. Remembering the difference between Creatinine and Creatine can be confusing because the words are so similar, so it helps to understand the sequence of events leading up to Creatinine getting released into the blood. First - Creatine is made in the liver and then transported to the muscle tissue to be used as an energy source for muscle contraction. Second - Creatinine then gets released into the blood due to muscle contraction or other conditions that result in muscle tissue breakdown. When Serum Creatinine is in the Clinical High range we must first consider if there is a problem with kidney function, and this should be correlated with other kidney function tests like BUN and GFR. High Creatinine combined with a high BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) and low GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) will create the greatest concern for altered kidney function and may require further evaluation with a specialist to determine the cause of abnormal kidney function or confirm the presence of kidney disease. High Creatinine can also be caused by other factors such as 1) dehydration, 2) extreme exercise (extreme muscle contraction) prior to getting your blood sample taken, 3) very high protein intake in diet, 4) high intake of a nutritional supplement called Creatine, 5) high Vitamin C intake, 6) any condition that results in faster breakdown or damage of muscle tissue, and 7) can be caused by some medications. It could also be that the kidneys are working fine but the flow of urine from the kidneys to the bladder and out of the body is being slowed down or obstructed due to an enlarged uterus or enlarged prostate. This would result in a back-up of Creatinine in the kidneys and then higher levels found in the blood and may require additional testing or examination to confirm."

   "description": "Your result for this lab test is in the FUNCTIONAL HIGH range. MCHC refers to Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration, or how much of the Red Blood Cell is occupied by Hemoglobin. This measurement is most helpful to evaluate if a person’s treatment for anemia is working and their anemia is improving. The reasons for MCHC in the Functional High range are nearly the same as when the MCV and MCH are in the Functional High range. When MCHC is in the Functional High range it may indicate an anemic tendency, but it alone would not meet the clinical definition of anemia and should be compared to other Red Blood Cells measurements. If other lab tests are confirming some type of anemia than the elevated MCHC would be indicating an anemia due to folic Acid or Vitamin B12 deficiency, and both of these B vitamins can be tested for directly in standard blood lab testing. Additional testing to confirm if the anemia is due to a Vitamin B12 deficiency can be done by doing a lab test for Methylmalonic Acid . . . with elevated levels of Methylmalonic Acid being a sensitive indicator of a Vitamin B12 deficiency. Another consideration when looking at Vitamin B12 deficiency is if there is enough Intrinsic Factor - a special protein produced by the stomach that allows you to properly absorb Vitamin B12 in the small intestine. This type of anemia in which there is too little Intrinsic Factor is called Pernicious Anemia, and can happen when the stomach is not producing enough Intrinsic Factor or with an auto-immune condition in which the immune system is attacking and destroying the Intrinsic Factor. Other reasons for a higher than optimal MCHC can include: 1) Poor health or function of the stomach or small intestine or low stomach acid production, 2) a liver problem, 3) underactive or hypo-thyroid function, 4) recent blood loss, or 6) the effect of some medications."

The reasons for MCHC in the Clinical Low range are nearly the same as when the MCV and MCH are in the Clinical Low range. When MCHC is in the Clinical Low range we will first conclude that some type of anemia is taking place, and investigate if this is from some type of iron deficiency resulting from: 1) poor iron intake, 2) poorly absorbing iron in the digestive system due to low stomach acid, digestive inflammation, or intestinal parasites, 3) a loss of blood due to bleeding from some type of trauma or injury, a bleeding processing within the digestive system such as an ulcer or colon cancer, a bladder or kidney infection resulting in blood loss through the urine, heavy menstrual bleeding in women, or other internal bleeding process that can slowly deplete the body of iron as the body is losing Red Blood Cells. Other reasons for a lower than optimal MCHC can include: 1) a Vitamin B6 deficiency, 2) a process in which Red Blood Cells are getting destroyed within the body - called hemolytic anemia, 3) a Vitamin C deficiency, 4) lead toxicity or other heavy metal toxicity in the body, or 4) the effect of some medications."

   "description": "Your result for this lab test is in the CLINICAL HIGH range. RDW refers to Red Blood Cell Distribution Width, and this test measures if there is an abnormal variation in the size or width of your Red Blood Cells in a blood sample. Your Red Blood Cells are normally a little larger in size when they are first created in the bone marrow and released into your blood stream. As these cells mature they decrease slightly in size and remain that way for the life of that cell - which is about 120 days. This means that your bone marrow should be constantly producing new Red Blood Cells to replace the ones that die and are removed from your blood. Therefore, in the same blood sample we expect to see a certain variation in the width of your Red Blood Cells as new ones are replacing old ones. If something is affecting the health of your Red Blood Cells and hemoglobin, and your body is sensing that not enough oxygen is getting transported to all the cells of your body, your bone marrow will then produce and release more new Red Blood Cells into your blood as a way to get more oxygen transported to your cells. This increases the ratio of the slightly larger new Red Blood Cells versus the slightly smaller more mature Red Blood Cells. This change in the variation of Red Blood Cells size is seen as an increase in the RDW, and is most often seen with some type of anemia. The RDW is only a relevant test for those people that have anemia, and is not a helpful measurement for those that do not have anemia.

   "description": "Your result for this lab test is in the FUNCTIONAL HIGH range. Neutrophils are one type of White Blood Cell, and they usually make-up the greatest percentage of the different kinds of White Blood Cells in a normal functioning immune system that is not fighting off an infection. This lab test is a calculation to determine the actual or absolute number of Neutrophils within a blood sample. When the total White Blood Cell count is elevated or decreased . . . looking at the absolute count of Neutrophils can be helpful in determining what type infection or challenge to the immune system is taking place. Neutrophils are primarily involved in fighting off bacterial infections. A common pattern to see in a more active or acute bacterial infection is the Neutrophils increased and the Lymphocytes decreased. When Neutrophils are in the Functional High range we will need to consider many sources to include: 1) very early stage of a more recent or acute bacterial infection or a lowering of Neutrophils from higher levels as an infection is becoming chronic, 2) an inflammatory process in the body, 4) adrenal problems, or 5) respiratory problems from asthma or emphysema."

   "description": "Your results for this lab test are in the Clinical High range. The term ‘NRBC’ – ‘nucleated red blood cells’ – refers to precursor cells of the red blood cell lineage which still contain a nucleus; they are also known as erythroblasts. In healthy adults and older children, NRBC can only be found in blood-building bone marrow where they mature. Their appearance in peripheral blood points to extramedullary erythropoiesis (outside the bone marrow) or disruption of the blood – bone marrow barrier. Both possible scenarios can only be found in the course of a severe disease. Physiologically, NRBC occur in peripheral blood only in neonatal and premature babies."

This lab test measures the total amount of Testosterone in ONLY the free or active form. When Free Testosterone is in the Functional High range we must first determine if this is due to an overexposure to the hormone from an external source, or from an overproduction of the hormone inside the body. Exposure to Testosterone from an external source could include: 1) someone who is on a Testosterone hormone therapy as prescribed by a medical provider; 2) being in close physical contact with someone who is using a Testosterone lotion, gel or cream as part of a prescribed hormone therapy resulting in the hormone being absorbed into the skin of a second individual unintentionally; 3) the intentional intake of Testosterone as a steroid hormone for muscle building, performance enhancement, or other reasons. An abnormal overproduction of Testosterone from within the body could include testicular tumors, adrenal tumors that are producing testosterone, or pituitary tumors that are causing an overproduction of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) which signal the testicles (in men) to produce Testosterone. A Functional High level of Testosterone is abnormal and should be evaluated by a qualified healthcare provider to determine the origin of the problem if the cause is unknown to the patient."

Testosterone exists in your body in an active form called the “Free” form, and in an inactive form where Testosterone is not available for use by your body because it is bound to a protein. This lab test measures the total amount of Testosterone in ONLY the free or active form. When Free Testosterone is in the Functional High range we must first determine if this is due to an overexposure to the hormone from an external source, or from an overproduction of the hormone inside the body. Exposure to Testosterone from an external source could include: 1) someone who is on a Testosterone hormone therapy as prescribed by a medical provider; 2) being in close physical contact with someone who is using a Testosterone lotion, gel or cream as part of a prescribed hormone therapy resulting in the hormone being absorbed into the skin of a second individual unintentionally; 3) the intentional intake of Testosterone as a steroid hormone for muscle building, performance enhancement, or other reasons. An abnormal overproduction of Testosterone from within the body could include testicular tumors, adrenal tumors that are producing testosterone, or pituitary tumors that are causing an overproduction of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) which signal the testicles (in men) to produce Testosterone. A Functional High level of Testosterone is abnormal and should be evaluated by a qualified healthcare provider to determine the origin of the problem if the cause is unknown to the patient."

Cholesterol is part of the cell membrane (the outer layer of the cell) for all the cells in your body, so Cholesterol is necessary for healthy cells. About 60% of your brain is made up of fat and Cholesterol, so having enough Cholesterol is needed for a healthy brain and nervous system.

It also means that if Cholesterol is too low it could indicate a person has an underactive or hypo-liver function since the liver produces the majority of cholesterol found in the body.

   "description": "Your result for this test is in the OPTIMAL range. Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) is the total amount of cholesterol contained in lipoproteins other than high-density lipoprotein (HDL). HDL is a particle that contains cholesterol, which is called HDL cholesterol or HDL-C. Non-HDL-C is calculated from the results of a lipid profile by subtracting the HDL-C result from the total cholesterol. Lipoproteins are responsible for the transport and metabolism of cholesterol. Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) transport cholesterol from the liver to other tissues, including blood vessel walls. Therefore, high LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) is considered to be associated with the development of hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). High density lipoproteins (HDL) have an inverse function - they transport cholesterol from the blood vessels to the liver, thus providing protection against CVD. Monitoring and maintaining healthy levels of lipids is important for staying healthy. Eating too much of foods that are high in saturated fats and trans unsaturated fats (trans fats) or having an inherited predisposition can result in a high level of cholesterol in the blood. The extra cholesterol may be deposited in plaques on the walls of blood vessels. Plaques can narrow or eventually block the opening of blood vessels, leading to atherosclerosis and increased risk of numerous health problems, including heart disease and stroke. Additionally, rupture of plaque can cause a heart attack. In the standard lipid profile, the level of total cholesterol and HDL-C are measured. LDL-C is usually not measured directly but is calculated from the results of the other components of the lipid profile, including total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides. Non-HDL-C may be reported as part of the lipid profile. It reflects the amount of cholesterol in all fractions of lipoproteins that may contribute to your risk of heart disease (atherogenic): LDL, intermediate and very low density lipoproteins (IDL, VLDL) and lipoprotein a (Lp (a))."

The “Cardiac” portion of this lab test name refers the High Sensitivity version of this lab test. This means we are trying to detect smaller levels of this protein due to inflammation which has also been shown to be a risk factor for cardiovascular problems, and its ability to predict the risk of a future cardiovascular event such as heart attack and stroke. However, the inflammation may be located anywhere in the body and is not specific to only the cardiovascular system. Inflammation has the nickname of the “silent killer” because inflammation often precedes many of the chronic diseases that people suffer with when they get older. Identifying inflammation now and getting it under control could very well help to prevent a health problem later in life, or at the very least help to reduce the severity of a future health problem."

Hypoglycemia can also contribute to feelings of anxiety or panic attacks. People with Reactive Hypoglycemia often have “insulin resistance” . . . meaning the cells in your body have become resistant to the effect of insulin. Insulin is a hormone produced by your pancreas which helps to transport sugar from the blood and bring it into your cells to be used as energy. If your cells become resistant to the effect of insulin, then blood sugar levels will usually go much higher before the body will correct this and bring these glucose levels back down. This can often result in your blood sugar levels dropping down too fast causing low blood sugar or hypoglycemia. These ups and downs of blood sugar, and the tendency for insulin resistance and hypoglycemia, can be the beginning of what turns into diabetes later in life."

Since almost all Creatinine is removed by the kidneys . . . testing blood levels of Creatinine is a good measure of how well the kidneys are working. Creatinine is also relative to the amount of muscle on the body, so a person with higher muscle mass will have slightly higher Creatinine levels and a person with low muscle mass will have slightly lower levels. Creatinine is derived from Creatine which is used as a source of energy in muscle contraction and is produced mostly within in the liver. Remembering the difference between Creatinine and Creatine can be confusing because the words are so similar, so it helps to understand the sequence of events leading up to Creatinine getting released into the blood. First - Creatine is made in the liver and then transported to the muscle tissue to be used as an energy source for muscle contraction. Second - Creatinine then gets released into the blood due to muscle contraction or other conditions that result in muscle tissue breakdown."

The GFR refers to the amount of blood that is filtered by the Glomeruli per minute. As kidney function declines due to disease or damage, the rate at which your blood gets filtered by your kidneys also decreases and waste products begin to build-up in your blood. This lab test combines your level of Creatinine with a formula that factors in your age, sex and race to determine your eGFR (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate). Low GFR along with a high BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) and high Creatinine will create the greatest concern for altered kidney function and may require further evaluation with a specialist to determine the cause of abnormal kidney function or confirm the presence of kidney disease."

   "description": "Your result for this lab test is in the OPTIMAL range. Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the body, and the majority of the calcium in your body is stored in your bone tissue. Therefore, most people will associate calcium with bone density and preventing osteoporosis. However, calcium is involved in many other important functions of the body including muscle function, nervous system function, heart function, your immune system, blood clotting and the repair of damaged tissues, and more. Your ability to absorb calcium is highly dependent on having enough stomach acid (HCL) available during digestion, so low stomach acid can equal poor calcium absorption. Calcium levels in your blood are most greatly controlled by your parathyroid gland . . . which is a group of 4 small glands that sit on the backside of the thyroid gland (two on each side). Calcium levels are also strongly influenced by Vitamin D which helps improve the absorption of calcium from the intestines into the blood. Calcium travels in the blood in both a freely available ionized form, and in a non-available form that is bound to other proteins - most commonly albumin. This makes it important to also look at Serum Albumin levels when interpreting Serum Calcium levels. Please note that a low Serum Calcium does not automatically mean you are in need of additional calcium or that you are at risk for lower bone density, and is not a good method for tracking osteoporosis. Other factors should also be considered when interpreting Serum Calcium, such as magnesium levels, Vitamin D levels and how different hormones will influence calcium levels.<br><br>When Serum Calcium levels are HIGHER than optimal we must consider if a person is taking too much Vitamin D in supplement form. Sometimes those people on thyroid medications can have slightly elevated calcium levels. Calcium levels in the blood are very carefully controlled by the body, so if blood testing reveals Serum Calcium to be at very high levels then this indicates some other problem in the body - possible with the parathyroid gland - and this person will likely need to go to a specialist for more testing. When Serum Calcium levels are LOWER than optimal we know that this could be due to several factors, but it is safe to conclude that the body may be in need of more calcium."

In reality AST is found in many organs and tissues of the body that are considered to be highly metabolic, or simply more active on a daily basis to include: liver, skeletal muscles, heart muscle, brain, kidney, pancreas and lungs . . . but this enzyme is found in the greatest quantity within the liver and heart. AST is an enzyme that will show up in the blood when there is damage or destruction of cells in these more metabolically active tissues. You may know of someone who needed to periodically get their “liver checked” while begin on a medication - such as a cholesterol medication. They were most likely getting these two main liver enzymes tested (AST and ALT) as a common screening test for liver function in blood testing. Your liver has many important functions in the body including: removing chemicals and toxins from the body, it’s involved in blood sugar control, it activates the majority of thyroid hormone into its more bioactive form (T3) to improve energy and metabolism, and much more. Your liver is a very resilient organ, as you can have as little as 20% of good liver function and still have these liver enzymes test in the normal range. This means that when the AST begins to test outside the optimal range we want to take action more quickly to help improve function before any more damage happens to the liver or other affected tissues."

   "description": "Your result for this lab test is in the Optimal range. Magnesium is involved in hundreds of chemical and enzyme reactions within the body, and it’s one of the most common mineral deficiencies. Magnesium is needed for many functions in the body to include: energy production, sugar metabolism, hormone balance, balance of brain chemistry, memory, heart function, and most notably for proper muscle function. About half of your magnesium is found within the soft tissues and muscles of your body, and the rest is in bone tissue. Your body needs enough magnesium for your muscles to relax properly. People who suffer with chronic muscle tightness, or even muscle cramps – such as “charlie horses” in the foot or calf muscles waking a person up from their sleep at night – are often symptoms of a magnesium deficiency. Magnesium not only affects the function of the skeletal muscles (the muscles that allow you to move your body), but it also affects the muscles that control your blood vessels. You have small muscles in your blood vessels that control how dilated (open) or contracted (closed) your blood vessels are. A magnesium deficiency could lead to tighter muscles in your blood vessels and result in them being more contracted (closed) and therefore higher blood pressure. Considering how common magnesium deficiency in our society is, this is likely to be one of many factors that contribute to High Blood Pressure. Taking magnesium may result in a decrease of chronically High Blood Pressure."

A final consideration is when Uric Acid levels are high along with other abnormal kidney function lab tests . . . you may then want to consult with a specialist to rule out kidney disease.

   "description": "Your result for this lab test is in the OPTIMAL range. TSH refers to Thyroid Stimulating Hormone and it is with this hormone that the brain (or more specifically a part of the brain called the pituitary) is able to control the thyroid gland and the production of thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone plays a major role in controlling your metabolism and energy production. If the brain senses too little thyroid hormone in the body then TSH will increase to tell the thyroid to produce more hormone. If the brain senses there is too much thyroid hormone in the body then TSH will decrease as a way of telling the thyroid to produce less hormone. TSH is the most common lab test performed by doctors to measure thyroid function. However, too many health providers rely on this test as the only measure of thyroid function, and this can be very misleading. The TSH lab result can be in the labs normal range and a person can still have altered thyroid function as determined by other thyroid lab tests. This overreliance on TSH as a primary indicator of thyroid function has resulted in millions of people not getting properly diagnosed with a real thyroid problem. A more comprehensive testing of thyroid function should be performed to have greater confidence that the thyroid gland is truly working at an optimal level . . . especially when a person is struggling with several symptoms of poor thyroid function. The thyroid has the nickname of the “great mimicker” because poor thyroid function can cause many symptoms and mimic many other health conditions. Some people go from one doctor to another trying to find out what is causing their symptoms . . . only to find out that their poor thyroid function is playing a major role in their health problems. Symptoms of underactive or hypo-thyroid function can include: fatigue, weight gain, soreness in muscles and joints, headaches, depression, constipation, slow metabolism, hair falling out, dry skin, intolerance to cold, menstrual changes in women, and more. Symptoms of overactive or hyper-thyroid function can include: sudden weight loss, anxiety and nervousness, rapid heartbeat, hands and fingers trembling, increased sweating, enlarged thyroid gland / swelling of the neck, difficulty sleeping, and more. Because poor thyroid function can affect many metabolic functions within the body, and can alter many lab results (not just the ones testing thyroid directly) . . . improving thyroid function becomes a higher \"priority\" when it’s discovered that it’s not functioning at an optimal level."

Hemoglobin is an important part of your Red Blood Cells that allows you to pick-up oxygen from your lungs and transports that oxygen to all the cells of your body. It also helps transport carbon dioxide from your cells back to the lungs to be removed from your body when you exhale during breathing."

Understand that your blood is made up of both liquid and solid particles. The liquid is referred to as plasma, and the solid particles are things like Red Blood Cells, White Blood Cells, Platelets, and more. Hematocrit is telling us what percentage of a blood sample is purely Red Blood Cells. Hematocrit will usually travel in the same direction of the RBC count, unless the individual Red Blood Cells are smaller or larger than normal in size or volume."

   "description": "Your result for this lab test is in the OPTIMAL range. RDW refers to Red Blood Cell Distribution Width, and this test measures if there is an abnormal variation in the size or width of your Red Blood Cells in a blood sample. Your Red Blood Cells are normally a little larger in size when they are first created in the bone marrow and released into your blood stream. As these cells mature they decrease slightly in size and remain that way for the life of that cell - which is about 120 days. This means that your bone marrow should be constantly producing new Red Blood Cells to replace the ones that die and are removed from your blood. Therefore, in the same blood sample we expect to see a certain variation in the width of your Red Blood Cells as new ones are replacing old ones. If something is affecting the health of your Red Blood Cells and hemoglobin, and your body is sensing that not enough oxygen is getting transported to all the cells of your body, your bone marrow will then produce and release more new Red Blood Cells into your blood as a way to get more oxygen transported to your cells. This increases the ratio of the slightly larger new Red Blood Cells versus the slightly smaller more mature Red Blood Cells. This change in the variation of Red Blood Cells size is seen as an increase in the RDW, and is most often seen with some type of anemia. The RDW is only a relevant test for those people that have anemia, and is not a helpful measurement for those that do not have anemia."

Lymphocytes are created in the bone marrow, and then travel to other tissues such as the thymus gland and spleen to mature into their active immune cell. Lymphocytes are primarily involved in fighting off viral infections, and they often become activated with inflammation. A common pattern to see with a viral infection is the Lymphocytes increased and the Neutrophils decreased."

   "description": "Your result for this lab test is in the OPTIMAL range. Monocytes are one type of White Blood Cell, and they can increase in response to a bacterial, viral or parasite infection. This test is to determine what percentage of total White Blood Cells are specifically Monocytes. Monocytes are produced in the bone marrow and then travel to tissues that are infected where they turn into a macrophage - a type of cell that consumes and removes infecting organisms, the fragments of damaged cells, and any other material left behind from an infection. It is typical to see Monocytes elevated in the final stages of an infection when the body is recovering from the infection. When Monocytes are in the Functional High range we will first consider if a person is recovering from some type of infection as it is typical for Monocytes to increase in the later stages of an infection to clean up the infected tissue. A more complete list of reasons why the Monocytes can be elevated include: 1) A bacterial or viral infection, 2) a parasite infection - often combined with elevated Eosinophils, 3) when a person has “Mono” referring to Mononucleosis caused by the Epstein-Barr virus - Mononucleosis simply refers to the presence of an abnormally large number of Monocytes in the blood, 4) an inflammatory process in the body, 5) a possible liver problem, and 6) a possible enlarged prostate in men over the age of 40 - often combined with increased Creatinine levels and increased LDH levels - specifically the LDH isoenzyme #4."

Your body uses iron to make hemoglobin, the protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout your body. If you don't have enough iron, you may not have enough hemoglobin. This condition is called iron deficiency anemia. Iron in your body is carried, or bound, mainly to a protein made by your liver called transferrin. The TIBC test is based on certain proteins, including transferrin, found in the blood. Your transferrin levels are almost always measured along with iron and TIBC. You may need these tests if your healthcare provider thinks your iron level is too low or too high. Not having enough iron in your diet is the most common cause of anemia and the most common type of diet deficiency in the U.S. Your healthcare provider may do this test to look at your diet, nutrition, liver, or other conditions that cause iron to be low, such as increased blood loss or pregnancy. Symptoms of iron deficiency include: •  Being tired and feeling weak •  Getting frequent infections • Feeling cold all the time • Having swelling in the tongue • Struggling to keep up at school or work • In children, having delayed mental development Symptoms of too much iron can include: • Feeling tired and weak •  Joint pain •  Belly pain"
