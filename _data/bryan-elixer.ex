      description: "Testosterone, Free Your result for this lab test is in the CLINICAL LOW range. Testosterone is the main sex hormone in men, and it is responsible for male physical characteristics. Although it is considered to be a "male" sex hormone, it is present in the blood of both men and women. Testosterone is mainly produced by special endocrine tissue (the Leydig cells) in the male testicles. It is also produced by the adrenal glands in both men and women, and by the ovaries in small amounts in women. Testosterone levels are diurnal, peaking in the early morning hours (about 4:00 to 8:00 am), with the lowest levels in the evening (about 4:00 to 8:00 pm). Levels also increase after exercise and also decrease with age. Testosterone exists in your body in an active form called the “Free” form, and in an inactive form where Testosterone is not available for use by your body because it is bound to a protein. This lab test measures the total amount of Testosterone in ONLY the free or active form. When Free Testosterone is in the Clinical Low range we must determine why the internal production of Testosterone is low which could include: 1) damage or dysfunction of the testicles; 2) poor function of the adrenals which also produce a small amount of Testosterone; 3) poor function of the pituitary and hypothalamus which give direction to the testicles on their hormone production; 4) chemical, heavy metal or other toxicity in the body which can affect hormone production and function; 5) issues related to poor blood sugar control and diabetes; 6) alcoholism; 7) viral disease or infection; 8) some type of genetic disease or condition resulting in lower Testosterone production. There are also several nutritional elements when low or deficient in the body that can affect testosterone production."

There are also several nutritional elements when low or deficient in the body that can affect testosterone production."

An abnormal overproduction of Testosterone from within the body could include testicular tumors, adrenal tumors that are producing testosterone, or pituitary tumors that are causing an overproduction of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) which signal the testicles (in men) to produce Testosterone. A Clinical High level of Testosterone is abnormal and should be evaluated by a qualified healthcare provider to determine the origin of the problem if the cause is unknown to the patient."

      description: "Your result for this lab test is in the CLINICAL LOW range. Testosterone is the main sex hormone in men, and it is responsible for male physical characteristics. Although it is considered to be a "male" sex hormone, it is present in the blood of both men and women. Testosterone is mainly produced by special endocrine tissue (the Leydig cells) in the male testicles. It is also produced by the adrenal glands in both men and women, and by the ovaries in small amounts in women. Testosterone levels are diurnal, peaking in the early morning hours (about 4:00 to 8:00 am), with the lowest levels in the evening (about 4:00 to 8:00 pm). Levels also increase after exercise and also decrease with age. Testosterone exists in your body in an active form called the “Free” form, and in an inactive form where Testosterone is not available for use by your body because it is bound to a protein. This lab test measures the total amount of Testosterone in your body in BOTH the active and inactive forms. When Total Testosterone is in the Clinical Low range we must determine why the internal production of Testosterone is low which could include: 1) damage or dysfunction of the testicles; 2) poor function of the adrenals which also produce a small amount of Testosterone; 3) poor function of the pituitary and hypothalamus which give direction to the testicles on their hormone production; 4) chemical, heavy metal or other toxicity in the body which can affect hormone production and function; 5) issues related to poor blood sugar control and diabetes; 6) alcoholism; 7) viral disease or infection; 8) some type of genetic disease or condition resulting in lower Testosterone production. There are also several nutritional elements when low or deficient in the body that can affect testosterone production."

      description:"Your result for this lab test is in the CLINICAL LOW range. This test measures the total level of Cholesterol in your body. Cholesterol circulates in your blood in different fractions or particles called lipoproteins, and these particles are usually referred to as HDL, LDL and VLDL. The sum total of HDL, LDL, and VLDL will equal your Total Cholesterol. Cholesterol is often communicated as a bad thing, and we are given the impression that we always need to get Cholesterol to a lower number to be healthy. The reality is that Cholesterol is needed to be healthy and it is essential for life. What many people don’t know is that in the original research on Cholesterol completed decades ago the researchers found that not only does high Cholesterol have a negative impact on health . . . mainly to your heart and cardiovascular system, but they also found that having low Cholesterol levels has its own unique set of consequences. Specifically, those people with low Cholesterol levels have an increased risk of developing cancer or other serious health problems over time. It will help you to understand some of the functions of cholesterol within your body. Cholesterol is part of the cell membrane (the outer layer of the cell) for all the cells in your body, so Cholesterol is necessary for healthy cells. About 60% of your brain is made up of fat and Cholesterol, so having enough Cholesterol is needed for a healthy brain and nervous system. Cholesterol is a precursor of what gets converted into many of the different hormones in your body . . . including the male and female hormones and adrenal hormones, so Cholesterol is needed for healthy hormone levels. Cholesterol is even a pretty good antioxidant . . . which means that it has the ability to protect your cells from getting damaged, and when your cells do get damaged Cholesterol can come to the rescue and help repair that cell damage. About 70% - 80% of the Cholesterol in your body is manufactured from within your own body . . . mostly by your liver. The remaining Cholesterol comes from your diet. So if Cholesterol is high it’s less likely due to dietary intake, and more likely because your liver is producing more Cholesterol because the body is sensing it needs more to improve the health of your cells, nervous system and hormones, or your body is in need of more antioxidants so your liver produces more Cholesterol for the antioxidant benefit it offers. It also means that if Cholesterol is too low it could indicate a person has an underactive or hypo-liver function since the liver produces the majority of cholesterol found in the body. The most reliable method for testing Cholesterol is after doing a 12 hour fasting . . . meaning there is no eating or drinking (except water) . . . for 12 hours prior to your blood draw. If the Cholesterol is high and a person did NOT do a proper 12 hour fasting . . . then this lab result is invalid and this should be re-tested if there are concerns about Cholesterol values. When the Total Cholesterol is in the Clinical Low range we will first consider if a person is on some type of Cholesterol lowering medication. If on a medication the patient may want to speak with their prescribing doctor to ask about reducing the dose or making some change to the medication . . . especially while making a serious effort to improve diet, lifestyle and using nutritional therapies to balance your body chemistry. Other factors that can contribute to a low Total Cholesterol include: 1) underactive or hypo-liver function or other problem affecting the liver, 2) overactive or hyper-thyroid function or a thyroid medication dose that is too high, 3) poor nutrition and/or very low fat intake, 4) a vegetarian or vegan diet, 5) poor absorption due to a digestive problem, or 6) overactive or hyper-adrenal function. It should be noted that a sudden drop in Total Cholesterol should alert one to some type of pathology or inflammatory condition, and this would be confirmed with other lab tests being out of range."

Cholesterol is a precursor of what gets converted into many of the different hormones in your body . . . including the male and female hormones and adrenal hormones, so Cholesterol is needed for healthy hormone levels. Cholesterol is even a pretty good antioxidant . . . which means that it has the ability to protect your cells from getting damaged, and when your cells do get damaged Cholesterol can come to the rescue and help repair that cell damage. About 70% - 80% of the Cholesterol in your body is manufactured from within your own body . . . mostly by your liver. The remaining Cholesterol comes from your diet. So if Cholesterol is high it’s less likely due to dietary intake, and more likely because your liver is producing more Cholesterol because the body is sensing it needs more to improve the health of your cells, nervous system and hormones, or your body is in need of more antioxidants so your liver produces more Cholesterol for the antioxidant benefit it offers. It also means that if Cholesterol is too low it could indicate a person has an underactive or hypo-liver function since the liver produces the majority of cholesterol found in the body. The most reliable method for testing Cholesterol is after doing a 12 hour fasting . . . meaning there is no eating or drinking (except water) . . . for 12 hours prior to your blood draw. If the Cholesterol is high and a person did NOT do a proper 12 hour fasting . . . then this lab result is invalid and this should be re-tested if there are concerns about Cholesterol values. When Total Cholesterol is in the Clinical High range we will first compare this to other lab results such as Triglycerides, HDL, LDL and thyroid tests . . . as these tests can give a better understanding of why Cholesterol is elevated. If Total Cholesterol is over 300 we begin to think about family genetics, especially if it’s been at this level for many years. If Total Cholesterol is initially discovered to be in the 200 – 240 range . . . the goal for the first few months is usually to try a more conservative therapy by improving diet, exercise, and lifestyle factors and to also balance other aspects of body chemistry to see if this will bring Cholesterol closer to the Optimal range. If the Total Cholesterol is initially discovered to be over 240, or if a more conservative therapy of diet, exercise and lifestyle has not worked . . . then a more aggressive nutritional therapy may be recommended to target the high Total Cholesterol with the therapeutic goal of bringing this to a healthier level more quickly. Factors that can contribute to a high Total Cholesterol may include: 1) blood sugar issues and/or a diet high in sugars and carbohydrates, 2) underactive or hypo-thyroid function, 3) a problem affecting the liver, 4) underactive or hypo-adrenal function, and 5) a problem affecting the pancreas. It should be noted that some people have an elevated Total Cholesterol due to an allergy or sensitivity to eggs and their Cholesterol will be difficult to improve unless egg is removed from their diet."

Having your HDL levels high enough will help to protect and improve the health of your blood vessels and can be a positive factor in preventing cardiovascular problems including heart attack and stroke. The best ways we know of to naturally improve or maintain healthy levels of HDL is through regular exercise, consuming enough Omega 3 Essential Fatty Acids (EFA), maintaining healthy blood sugar levels, and keeping your body at a healthy weight. When HDL Cholesterol is in the Clinical Low range there are several factors to consider to include: 1) Omega 3 EFA deficiency, 2) blood sugar issues or insulin resistance, 3) a problem affecting the liver, 4) a diet that is too high in sugar and carbohydrates, 5) overactive or hyper-thyroid function, 6) a lifestyle that is too sedentary / too little exercise, and 7) the effect of some medications."

A lipoprotein is a particle that helps to transport fats such as cholesterol and triglycerides through your bloodstream. LDL carries mostly cholesterol in your bloodstream bringing it to your cells and tissues because it is needed for many important functions. LDL is often called the “bad cholesterol” because excess amounts can result in cholesterol getting deposited in the walls of your blood vessels leading to hardening of the arteries and cardiovascular problems including heart attack and stroke. LDL (the bad cholesterol) has an inverse relationship with HDL (the good cholesterol) . . . meaning that as LDL increases HDL will often decrease. Many of the same things that will raise the good cholesterol (HDL) will also lower the bad cholesterol (LDL). When LDL Cholesterol is in the Functional High range there are many factors to consider to include: 1) Omega 3 EFA deficiency, 2) blood sugar issues or insulin resistance, 3) a problem affecting the liver, 4) a diet that is too high in sugar, carbohydrates, and saturated fats 5) underactive or hypo-thyroid function, 6) a lifestyle that is too sedentary / too little exercise, and 7) the effect of some medications."

Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) is the total amount of cholesterol contained in lipoproteins other than high-density lipoprotein (HDL). HDL is a particle that contains cholesterol, which is called HDL cholesterol or HDL-C. Non-HDL-C is calculated from the results of a lipid profile by subtracting the HDL-C result from the total cholesterol. Lipoproteins are responsible for the transport and metabolism of cholesterol. Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) transport cholesterol from the liver to other tissues, including blood vessel walls. Therefore, high LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) is considered to be associated with the development of hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). High density lipoproteins (HDL) have an inverse function - they transport cholesterol from the blood vessels to the liver, thus providing protection against CVD. Monitoring and maintaining healthy levels of lipids is important for staying healthy. Eating too much of foods that are high in saturated fats and trans unsaturated fats (trans fats) or having an inherited predisposition can result in a high level of cholesterol in the blood. The extra cholesterol may be deposited in plaques on the walls of blood vessels. Plaques can narrow or eventually block the opening of blood vessels, leading to atherosclerosis and increased risk of numerous health problems, including heart disease and stroke. Additionally, rupture of plaque can cause a heart attack. In the standard lipid profile, the level of total cholesterol and HDL-C are measured. LDL-C is usually not measured directly but is calculated from the results of the other components of the lipid profile, including total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides. Non-HDL-C may be reported as part of the lipid profile. It reflects the amount of cholesterol in all fractions of lipoproteins that may contribute to your risk of heart disease (atherogenic): LDL, intermediate and very low density lipoproteins (IDL, VLDL) and lipoprotein a (Lp (a))."

      description:  "Your result for this lab test is in the FUNCTIONAL LOW range. Serum Glucose is a measurement to see how well your body is controlling your blood sugar levels over a shorter period of time - about the past 12 - 24 hours. Glucose is the preferred source of fuel for all the cells in your body. It is also the most important source of fuel for your brain and nervous system which has the greatest need for healthy Glucose levels because it alone consumes about 50% of the glucose in your body. Your Glucose can vary quite a bit even within the same day based on what you are eating and drinking. The most reliable method for testing Serum Glucose is after doing a 12 hour fasting meaning there is no eating or drinking (except water) for 12 hours prior to your blood draw.
     When Glucose is in the Functional Low range it means your blood sugars are falling too low at times for the best function of your body. This is sometimes referred to as “Hypoglycemia” . . . which means low blood sugar. Glucose levels measuring in the 70’s and upper 60’s with lab testing can correlate with a condition called Functional Hypoglycemia or Reactive Hypoglycemia. People with this type of Hypoglycemia usually don’t feel good if they go too long between meals, and can experience symptoms of fatigue, weakness, headaches and even shakiness until they eat food to feel better again. Hypoglycemia can also contribute to feelings of anxiety or panic attacks. People with Reactive Hypoglycemia often have “insulin resistance” . . . meaning the cells in your body have become resistant to the effect of insulin. Insulin is a hormone produced by your pancreas which helps to transport sugar from the blood and bring it into your cells to be used as energy. If your cells become resistant to the effect of insulin, then blood sugar levels will usually go much higher before the body will correct this and bring these glucose levels back down. This can often result in your blood sugar levels dropping down too fast causing low blood sugar or hypoglycemia. These ups and downs of blood sugar, and the tendency for insulin resistance and hypoglycemia, can be the beginning of what turns into diabetes later in life."

It could also be that the kidneys are working fine but the flow of urine from the kidneys to the bladder and out of the body is being slowed down or obstructed due to an enlarged uterus or enlarged prostate. This would result in a back-up of Creatinine in the kidneys and then higher levels found in the blood and may require additional testing or examination to confirm."

Potassium is mostly regulated in your body by your kidneys and can serve as another indicator of kidney function, but potassium is also strongly influenced by adrenal hormone function and certain medications - such as diuretics."

Potassium is an electrolyte that is critical to cell metabolism and muscle function . . . including the proper function of your heart muscle. Potassium also helps to regulate the amount of fluid in your body, and helps in maintaining an acid-alkaline balance within your body.

Potassium is mostly regulated in your body by your kidneys and can serve as another indicator of kidney function, but potassium is also strongly influenced by adrenal hormone function and certain medications - such as diuretics. When potassium levels are in the Functional High range we must first rule out any type of kidney disease or kidney problem. Because potassium is affected by many prescribed medications we must next determine if a person is taking any of these medications that decrease the loss of potassium from the body and cause it to build-up in the blood. These medications often include heart medications, blood pressure medications, potassium-sparing diuretics, and anti-inflammatory medications. Also be aware that falsely elevated potassium can result from poor handling of the blood sample, allowing it to sit too long before analysis, and a person clenching or pumping their fist too much at the time of blood draw. Therefore, a second blood draw may be performed to confirm potassium levels if there is enough concern. When these factors have been ruled out, we then look at more common functional reasons such as: 1) a person being dehydrated at the time of blood draw, 2) poor adrenal gland function, 3) poor control of blood sugar and insulin levels - such as diabetes, 4) some type of cell or tissue destruction within the body - since most potassium is located within the cell, 5) and higher than optimal potassium can be a good indicator that the body chemistry has become too acidic."
