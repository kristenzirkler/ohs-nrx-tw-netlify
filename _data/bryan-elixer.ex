Testosterone is the main sex hormone in men, and it is responsible for male physical characteristics. Although it is considered to be a "male" sex hormone, it is present in the blood of both men and women. Testosterone is mainly produced by special endocrine tissue (the Leydig cells) in the male testicles. It is also produced by the adrenal glands in both men and women, and by the ovaries in small amounts in women. Testosterone levels are diurnal, peaking in the early morning hours (about 4:00 to 8:00 am), with the lowest levels in the evening (about 4:00 to 8:00 pm). Levels also increase after exercise and also decrease with age. Testosterone exists in your body in an active form called the “Free” form, and in an inactive form where Testosterone is not available for use by your body because it is bound to a protein. This lab test measures the total amount of Testosterone in ONLY the free or active form. When Free Testosterone is in the Clinical Low range we must determine why the internal production of Testosterone is low which could include: 1) damage or dysfunction of the testicles; 2) poor function of the adrenals which also produce a small amount of Testosterone; 3) poor function of the pituitary and hypothalamus which give direction to the testicles on their hormone production; 4) chemical, heavy metal or other toxicity in the body which can affect hormone production and function; 5) issues related to poor blood sugar control and diabetes; 6) alcoholism; 7) viral disease or infection; 8) some type of genetic disease or condition resulting in lower Testosterone production. There are also several nutritional elements when low or deficient in the body that can affect testosterone production."

Exposure to Testosterone from an external source could include: 1) someone who is on a Testosterone hormone therapy as prescribed by a medical provider; 2) being in close physical contact with someone who is using a Testosterone lotion, gel or cream as part of a prescribed hormone therapy resulting in the hormone being absorbed into the skin of a second individual unintentionally; 3) the intentional intake of Testosterone as a steroid hormone for muscle building, performance enhancement, or other reasons. An abnormal overproduction of Testosterone from within the body could include testicular tumors, adrenal tumors that are producing testosterone, or pituitary tumors that are causing an overproduction of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) which signal the testicles (in men) to produce Testosterone. A Functional High level of Testosterone is abnormal and should be evaluated by a qualified healthcare provider to determine the origin of the problem if the cause is unknown to the patient."

      description:"Your result for this lab test is in the FUNCTIONAL HIGH range. Testosterone is the main sex hormone in men, and it is responsible for male physical characteristics. Although it is considered to be a "male" sex hormone, it is present in the blood of both men and women. Testosterone is mainly produced by special endocrine tissue (the Leydig cells) in the male testicles. It is also produced by the adrenal glands in both men and women, and by the ovaries in small amounts in women.
      Testosterone levels are diurnal, peaking in the early morning hours (about 4:00 to 8:00 am), with the lowest levels in the evening (about 4:00 to 8:00 pm). Levels also increase after exercise and also decrease with age. Testosterone exists in your body in an active form called the “Free” form, and in an inactive form where Testosterone is not available for use by your body because it is bound to a protein. This lab test measures the total amount of Testosterone in your body in BOTH the active and inactive forms.
      When Total Testosterone is in the Functional High range we must first determine if this is due to overexposure to the hormone from an external source, or from an overproduction of the hormone inside the body. Exposure to Testosterone from an external source could include: 1) someone who is on a Testosterone hormone therapy as prescribed by a medical provider; 2) being in close physical contact with someone who is using a Testosterone lotion, gel or cream as part of a prescribed hormone therapy resulting in the hormone being absorbed into the skin of a second individual unintentionally; 3) the intentional intake of Testosterone as a steroid hormone for muscle building, performance enhancement, or other reasons. An abnormal overproduction of Testosterone from within the body could include testicular tumors, adrenal tumors that are producing testosterone, or pituitary tumors that are causing an overproduction of Luteinizing Hormone (LH) which signals the testicles (in men) to produce Testosterone. A Functional High level of Testosterone is abnormal and should be evaluated by a qualified healthcare provider to determine the origin of the problem if the cause is unknown to the patient."

      description:"Your result for this lab test is in the CLINICAL LOW range. This test measures the total level of Cholesterol in your body. Cholesterol circulates in your blood in different fractions or particles called lipoproteins, and these particles are usually referred to as HDL, LDL and VLDL. The sum total of HDL, LDL, and VLDL will equal your Total Cholesterol. Cholesterol is often communicated as a bad thing, and we are given the impression that we always need to get Cholesterol to a lower number to be healthy. The reality is that Cholesterol is needed to be healthy and it is essential for life. What many people don’t know is that in the original research on Cholesterol completed decades ago the researchers found that not only does high Cholesterol have a negative impact on health . . . mainly to your heart and cardiovascular system, but they also found that having low Cholesterol levels has its own unique set of consequences. Specifically, those people with low Cholesterol levels have an increased risk of developing cancer or other serious health problems over time. It will help you to understand some of the functions of cholesterol within your body. Cholesterol is part of the cell membrane (the outer layer of the cell) for all the cells in your body, so Cholesterol is necessary for healthy cells. About 60% of your brain is made up of fat and Cholesterol, so having enough Cholesterol is needed for a healthy brain and nervous system. Cholesterol is a precursor of what gets converted into many of the different hormones in your body . . . including the male and female hormones and adrenal hormones, so Cholesterol is needed for healthy hormone levels. Cholesterol is even a pretty good antioxidant . . . which means that it has the ability to protect your cells from getting damaged, and when your cells do get damaged Cholesterol can come to the rescue and help repair that cell damage. About 70% - 80% of the Cholesterol in your body is manufactured from within your own body . . . mostly by your liver. The remaining Cholesterol comes from your diet. So if Cholesterol is high it’s less likely due to dietary intake, and more likely because your liver is producing more Cholesterol because the body is sensing it needs more to improve the health of your cells, nervous system and hormones, or your body is in need of more antioxidants so your liver produces more Cholesterol for the antioxidant benefit it offers. It also means that if Cholesterol is too low it could indicate a person has an underactive or hypo-liver function since the liver produces the majority of cholesterol found in the body. The most reliable method for testing Cholesterol is after doing a 12 hour fasting . . . meaning there is no eating or drinking (except water) . . . for 12 hours prior to your blood draw. If the Cholesterol is high and a person did NOT do a proper 12 hour fasting . . . then this lab result is invalid and this should be re-tested if there are concerns about Cholesterol values. When the Total Cholesterol is in the Clinical Low range we will first consider if a person is on some type of Cholesterol lowering medication. If on a medication the patient may want to speak with their prescribing doctor to ask about reducing the dose or making some change to the medication . . . especially while making a serious effort to improve diet, lifestyle and using nutritional therapies to balance your body chemistry. Other factors that can contribute to a low Total Cholesterol include: 1) underactive or hypo-liver function or other problem affecting the liver, 2) overactive or hyper-thyroid function or a thyroid medication dose that is too high, 3) poor nutrition and/or very low fat intake, 4) a vegetarian or vegan diet, 5) poor absorption due to a digestive problem, or 6) overactive or hyper-adrenal function. It should be noted that a sudden drop in Total Cholesterol should alert one to some type of pathology or inflammatory condition, and this would be confirmed with other lab tests being out of range."

What many people don’t know is that in the original research on Cholesterol completed decades ago the researchers found that not only does high Cholesterol have a negative impact on health . . . mainly to your heart and cardiovascular system, but they also found that having low Cholesterol levels has its own unique set of consequences. Specifically, those people with low Cholesterol levels have an increased risk of developing cancer or other serious health problems over time. It will help you to understand some of the functions of cholesterol within your body. Cholesterol is part of the cell membrane (the outer layer of the cell) for all the cells in your body, so Cholesterol is necessary for healthy cells. About 60% of your brain is made up of fat and Cholesterol, so having enough Cholesterol is needed for a healthy brain and nervous system. Cholesterol is a precursor of what gets converted into many of the different hormones in your body . . . including the male and female hormones and adrenal hormones, so Cholesterol is needed for healthy hormone levels. Cholesterol is even a pretty good antioxidant . . . which means that it has the ability to protect your cells from getting damaged, and when your cells do get damaged Cholesterol can come to the rescue and help repair that cell damage. About 70% - 80% of the Cholesterol in your body is manufactured from within your own body . . . mostly by your liver. The remaining Cholesterol comes from your diet. So if Cholesterol is high it’s less likely due to dietary intake, and more likely because your liver is producing more Cholesterol because the body is sensing it needs more to improve the health of your cells, nervous system and hormones, or your body is in need of more antioxidants so your liver produces more Cholesterol for the antioxidant benefit it offers. It also means that if Cholesterol is too low it could indicate a person has an underactive or hypo- liver function since the liver produces the majority of cholesterol found in the body. The most reliable method for testing Cholesterol is after doing a 12 hour fasting . . . meaning there is no eating or drinking (except water) . . . for 12 hours prior to your blood draw. If the Cholesterol is high and a person did NOT do a proper 12 hour fasting . . . then this lab result is invalid and this should be re-tested if there are concerns about Cholesterol values. When the Total Cholesterol is in the Functional Low range we will first consider if a person is on some type of Cholesterol lowering medication. If on a medication the patient may want to speak with their prescribing doctor to ask about reducing the dose or making some change to the medication . . . especially while making a serious effort to improve diet, lifestyle and using nutritional therapies to balance your body chemistry. Other factors that can contribute to a low Total Cholesterol include: 1) underactive or hypo-liver function or other problem affecting the liver, 2) overactive or hyper-thyroid function or a thyroid medication dose that is too high, 3) poor nutrition and/or very low fat intake, 4) a vegetarian or vegan diet, 5) poor absorption due to a digestive problem, or 6) overactive or hyper-adrenal function. It should be noted that a sudden drop in Total Cholesterol should alert one to some type of pathology or inflammatory condition, and this would be confirmed with other lab tests being out of range"

When Total Cholesterol is in the Clinical High range we will first compare this to other lab results such as Triglycerides, HDL, LDL and thyroid tests . . . as these tests can give a better understanding of why Cholesterol is elevated. If Total Cholesterol is over 300 we begin to think about family genetics, especially if it’s been at this level for many years. If Total Cholesterol is initially discovered to be in the 200 – 240 range . . . the goal for the first few months is usually to try a more conservative therapy by improving diet, exercise, and lifestyle factors and to also balance other aspects of body chemistry to see if this will bring Cholesterol closer to the Optimal range. If the Total Cholesterol is initially discovered to be over 240, or if a more conservative therapy of diet, exercise and lifestyle has not worked . . . then a more aggressive nutritional therapy may be recommended to target the high Total Cholesterol with the therapeutic goal of bringing this to a healthier level more quickly. Factors that can contribute to a high Total Cholesterol may include: 1) blood sugar issues and/or a diet high in sugars and carbohydrates, 2) underactive or hypo-thyroid function, 3) a problem affecting the liver, 4) underactive or hypo-adrenal function, and 5) a problem affecting the pancreas. It should be noted that some people have an elevated Total Cholesterol due to an allergy or sensitivity to eggs and their Cholesterol will be difficult to improve unless egg is removed from their diet."

LDL (the bad cholesterol) has an inverse relationship with HDL (the good cholesterol) . . . meaning that as LDL increases HDL will often decrease.

Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) is the total amount of cholesterol contained in lipoproteins other than high-density lipoprotein (HDL). HDL is a particle that contains cholesterol, which is called HDL cholesterol or HDL-C. Non-HDL-C is calculated from the results of a lipid profile by subtracting the HDL-C result from the total cholesterol. Lipoproteins are responsible for the transport and metabolism of cholesterol. Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) transport cholesterol from the liver to other tissues, including blood vessel walls. Therefore, high LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) is considered to be associated with the development of hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). High density lipoproteins (HDL) have an inverse function - they transport cholesterol from the blood vessels to the liver, thus providing protection against CVD. Monitoring and maintaining healthy levels of lipids is important for staying healthy. Eating too much of foods that are high in saturated fats and trans unsaturated fats (trans fats) or having an inherited predisposition can result in a high level of cholesterol in the blood. The extra cholesterol may be deposited in plaques on the walls of blood vessels. Plaques can narrow or eventually block the opening of blood vessels, leading to atherosclerosis and increased risk of numerous health problems, including heart disease and stroke. Additionally, rupture of plaque can cause a heart attack. In the standard lipid profile, the level of total cholesterol and HDL-C are measured. LDL-C is usually not measured directly but is calculated from the results of the other components of the lipid profile, including total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides. Non-HDL-C may be reported as part of the lipid profile. It reflects the amount of cholesterol in all fractions of lipoproteins that may contribute to your risk of heart disease (atherogenic): LDL, intermediate and very low density lipoproteins (IDL, VLDL) and lipoprotein a (Lp (a))."

Serum Glucose is a measurement to see how well your body is controlling your blood sugar levels over a shorter period of time - about the past 12 - 24 hours. Glucose is the preferred source of fuel for all the cells in your body. It is also the most important source of fuel for your brain and nervous system which has the greatest need for healthy Glucose levels because it alone consumes about 50% of the glucose in your body. Your Glucose can vary quite a bit even within the same day based on what you are eating and drinking. The most reliable method for testing Serum Glucose is after doing a 12 hour fasting meaning there is no eating or drinking (except water) for 12 hours prior to your blood draw.
      When Glucose is in the Functional Low range it means your blood sugars are falling too low at times for the best function of your body. This is sometimes referred to as “Hypoglycemia” . . . which means low blood sugar. Glucose levels measuring in the 70’s and upper 60’s with lab testing can correlate with a condition called Functional Hypoglycemia or Reactive Hypoglycemia. People with this type of Hypoglycemia usually don’t feel good if they go too long between meals, and can experience symptoms of fatigue, weakness, headaches and even shakiness until they eat food to feel better again. Hypoglycemia can also contribute to feelings of anxiety or panic attacks. People with Reactive Hypoglycemia often have “insulin resistance” . . . meaning the cells in your body have become resistant to the effect of insulin. Insulin is a hormone produced by your pancreas which helps to transport sugar from the blood and bring it into your cells to be used as energy. If your cells become resistant to the effect of insulin, then blood sugar levels will usually go much higher before the body will correct this and bring these glucose levels back down. This can often result in your blood sugar levels dropping down too fast causing low blood sugar or hypoglycemia. These ups and downs of blood sugar, and the tendency for insulin resistance and hypoglycemia, can be the beginning of what turns into diabetes later in life."

If your cells become resistant to the effect of insulin, then blood sugar levels will usually go much higher before the body will correct this and bring these glucose levels back down. This can often result in your blood sugar levels dropping down too fast causing low blood sugar or hypoglycemia. These ups and downs of blood sugar, and the tendency for insulin resistance and hypoglycemia, can be the beginning of what turns into diabetes later in life."

Serum Glucose is a measurement to see how well your body is controlling your blood sugar levels over a shorter period of time - about the past 12 - 24 hours. Glucose is the preferred source of fuel for all the cells in your body. It is also the most important source of fuel for your brain and nervous system which has the greatest need for healthy Glucose levels because it alone consumes about 50% of the glucose in your body. Your Glucose can vary quite a bit even within the same day based on what you are eating and drinking. The most reliable method for testing Serum Glucose is after doing a 12 hour fasting meaning there is no eating or drinking (except water) for 12 hours prior to your blood draw."

      When Total Carbon Dioxide is in the Clinical High range we must first consider if this is due to a respiratory (lung) problem or a metabolic (body chemistry) problem. In a respiratory problem the lungs are not able to remove Carbon Dioxide (CO2) gas from the blood as effectively, and CO2 begins to build-up in the blood. Carbon Dioxide as a blood gas is mainly an acid element, and the body will respond by producing more bicarbonate (which is really what is being measured in this blood test for Total Carbon Dioxide) to help reduce the acidity from this “respiratory acidosis”. A person may need to see a specialist and have blood gas testing done to determine if the Clinical High CO2 is due to a respiratory issue.

      A metabolic problem leading to elevated Total Carbon Dioxide is most often indicating a more alkaline body chemistry from causes including: 1) a problem affecting the kidneys, 2) overactive or hyper-adrenal function, 3) blood sugar issues, 4) low stomach acid - especially if induce by excessive bicarbonate antacid intake, and 5) the effect of some medications."

      When Serum Calcium is significantly elevated in the Clinical High range we must first consider a problem with the parathyroid gland. An increase in parathyroid hormone in the blood will also greatly increase the amount of calcium in the blood. A person with a highly elevated Serum Calcium will likely need more testing or to see a specialist (such as an endocrinologist) to determine the presence of a parathyroid problem. An overactive parathyroid gland resulting in a highly elevated Serum Calcium can have many health consequences.

      It will be more common to see Serum Calcium only slight elevated into the Clinical High range, and we must first consider if there is a thyroid problem. It is somewhat common to see a slightly elevated Serum Calcium when a person has an overactive thyroid gland - called hyperthyroidism, or if they are taking thyroid medication dose that is too high for their body. This should first be correlated with the thyroid lab testing to determine if there is a thyroid problem, or it their thyroid medication dose is appropriate. Slightly elevated calcium could also be due to: 1) Excessive Vitamin D intake, 2) destruction of cells releasing Calcium into the serum, 3) underactive or hypo-adrenal function, or 4) other hormone problem."

Your liver has many important functions in the body including: removing chemicals and toxins from the body, it’s involved in blood sugar control, it activates the majority of thyroid hormone into its more bioactive form (T3) to improve energy and metabolism, and much more. Your liver is a very resilient organ, as you can have as little as 20% of good liver function and still have these liver enzymes test in the normal range. This means that when the AST begins to test outside the optimal range we want to take action more quickly to help improve function before any more damage happens to the liver or other affected tissues. When AST is in the Functional High range we first think of a problem affecting the liver.

      description: "Your result for this lab test is in the FUNCTIONAL LOW range. ALT (SGPT) refers to an enzyme called Alanine Aminotransferase, and this test is commonly called a liver enzyme test. In reality ALT is found in several organs and tissues to include: liver, skeletal muscles, heart muscle, and kidney . . . but this enzyme is found in the greatest quantity within the liver. ALT is an enzyme that will show up in the blood when there is damage or destruction of cells in these tissues. You may know of someone who needed to periodically get their “liver checked” while begin on a medication - such as a cholesterol medication. They were most likely getting these two main liver enzymes tested (AST and ALT) as a common screening test for liver function in blood testing. Your liver has many important functions in the body including: removing chemicals and toxins from the body, it’s involved in blood sugar control, it activates the majority of thyroid hormone into its more bioactive form (T3) to improve energy and metabolism, and much more. Your liver is a very resilient organ, as you can have as little as 20% of good liver function and still have these liver enzymes test in the normal range. This means that when the ALT begins to test outside the optimal range we want to take action more quickly to help improve function before any more damage happens to the liver or other affected tissues. When ALT is in the Functional Low range it is likely telling us that there is an underactive or hypo-liver function and/or a deficiency of certain B vitamins. Specifically Vitamin B6 is needed by the liver in order to create the ALT liver enzyme, so a low ALT can indicate a need for more Vitamin B6."

Although it is referred to as a vitamin . . . the active form of Vitamin D functions in many ways like a hormone in the way it communicates and controls the function of your cells. The benefits of Vitamin D include: 1) improving blood sugar control because your pancreas needs Vitamin D in the manufacture of insulin, 2) improving the balance of brain chemistry, 3) improving the balance of female and male hormones, 4) improving energy levels - some people have noticed an increase in energy after taking the proper therapeutic dose of Vitamin D3 based on the results of lab testing, 5) improved immune function - fewer colds and flu, 6) improving bone density by helping to bring digested calcium into the blood so it can then be incorporated into bone tissue, and 7) the ability to reduce an auto-immune reaction within the body. One of the most important benefits of Vitamin D is the cancer-protective effect it has on your cells. Vitamin D helps to prevent the proliferation (or abnormal growth) of cells within your body . . . and this is really what most cancers are . . . cells that are growing in an abnormal and uncontrolled way. The effect of Vitamin D to help suppress the growth of abnormal cells is powerful enough to make this an important consideration in cancer prevention, and in making your cells healthy again once cancer has become establish within the body. Vitamin D3 is the active or bioavailable form of Vitamin D, and is the preferred form when taken as a supplement. This is the form of Vitamin D your body produces when your skin is exposed to sunlight. Care should be taken to let lab testing guide your daily dose of Vitamin D3 when taking it by supplement. Taking too much Vitamin D can become harmful if taken in excess for a longer period of time, and taking too small of a dose may have little to no benefit. Also, some people seem to improve and retain their Vitamin D levels better than others, so a recommended dose of Vitamin D3 can vary quite a bit from one person to another and should be determined based on the results of lab testing for Vitamin D. When Vitamin D is in the Clinical Low range this usually means that a person is not receiving enough sunlight exposure to their skin, or they are not getting enough through foods that are fortified with Vitamin D. Since the cancer protective and many other health benefits of Vitamin D are realized when it is in the Optimal range . . . taking Vitamin D3 in supplement form would be appropriate to increase your levels. Follow-up lab testing of Vitamin D is recommended to make sure levels have improved, and to make sure your Vitamin D levels have not gone too high."

      description: "Your result for this lab test is in the CLINICAL LOW range. Magnesium is involved in hundreds of chemical and enzyme reactions within the body, and it’s one of the most common mineral deficiencies. Magnesium is needed for many functions in the body to include: energy production, sugar metabolism, hormone balance, balance of brain chemistry, memory, heart function, and most notably for proper muscle function. About half of your magnesium is found within the soft tissues and muscles of your body, and the rest is in bone tissue. Your body needs enough magnesium for your muscles to relax properly. People who suffer with chronic muscle tightness, or even muscle cramps – such as “charlie horses” in the foot or calf muscles waking a person up from their sleep at night – are often symptoms of a magnesium deficiency. Magnesium not only affects the function of the skeletal muscles (the muscles that allow you to move your body), but it also affects the muscles that control your blood vessels. You have small muscles in your blood vessels that control how dilated (open) or contracted (closed) your blood vessels are. A magnesium deficiency could lead to tighter muscles in your blood vessels and result in them being more contracted (closed) and therefore higher blood pressure. Considering how common magnesium deficiency in our society is, this is likely to be one of many factors that contribute to High Blood Pressure. Taking magnesium may result in a decrease of chronically High Blood Pressure."

TSH refers to Thyroid Stimulating Hormone and it is with this hormone that the brain (or more specifically a part of the brain called the pituitary) is able to control the thyroid gland and the production of thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone plays a major role in controlling your metabolism and energy production. If the brain senses too little thyroid hormone in the body then TSH will increase to tell the thyroid to produce more hormone. If the brain senses there is too much thyroid hormone in the body then TSH will decrease as a way of telling the thyroid to produce less hormone. TSH is the most common lab test performed by doctors to measure thyroid function. However, too many health providers rely on this test as the only measure of thyroid function, and this can be very misleading. The TSH lab result can be in the labs normal range and a person can still have altered thyroid function as determined by other thyroid lab tests. This overreliance on TSH as a primary indicator of thyroid function has resulted in millions of people not getting properly diagnosed with a real thyroid problem. A more comprehensive testing of thyroid function should be performed to have greater confidence that the thyroid gland is truly working at an optimal level . . . especially when a person is struggling with several symptoms of poor thyroid function. The thyroid has the nickname of the “great mimicker” because poor thyroid function can cause many symptoms and mimic many other health conditions. Some people go from one doctor to another trying to find out what is causing their symptoms . . . only to find out that their poor thyroid function is playing a major role in their health problems. Symptoms of underactive or hypo-thyroid function can include: fatigue, weight gain, soreness in muscles and joints, headaches, depression, constipation, slow metabolism, hair falling out, dry skin, intolerance to cold, menstrual changes in women, and more. Symptoms of overactive or hyper-thyroid function can include: sudden weight loss, anxiety and nervousness, rapid heartbeat, hands and fingers trembling, increased sweating, enlarged thyroid gland / swelling of the neck, difficulty sleeping, and more. Because poor thyroid function can affect many metabolic functions within the body, and can alter many lab results (not just the ones testing thyroid directly) . . . improving thyroid function becomes a higher priority when it’s discovered that it’s not functioning at an optimal level. When the TSH is in the Clinical Low range this will indicate an overactive or hyper-thyroid function. It will help to compare this with other thyroid lab tests to confirm hyperthyroidism. Many thyroid conditions involve an autoimmune reaction in which your immune system is attacking the thyroid gland or some aspect of thyroid function, so it will be helpful to also do thyroid antibody testing as this may change your dietary or therapeutic nutritional recommendations if your thyroid problems are in part due to an autoimmune condition. Other factors that can contribute to TSH in the Clinical Low range may include: 1) a pituitary problem as the pituitary produces TSH to control the thyroid gland, 2) a hypothalamus problem as the hypothalamus controls the pituitary and this is really the beginning of the hormonal communication within the body, 3) chemicals or toxic heavy metals in the body disrupting thyroid function, or 4) the effect of some medications - including taking a thyroid medication dose that is too high for your body if on thyroid medication."

      description: "Your result for this lab test is in the CLINICAL HIGH range. TSH refers to Thyroid Stimulating Hormone and it is with this hormone that the brain (or more specifically a part of the brain called the pituitary) is able to control the thyroid gland and the production of thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone plays a major role in controlling your metabolism and energy production. If the brain senses too little thyroid hormone in the body then TSH will increase to tell the thyroid to produce more hormone. If the brain senses there is too much thyroid hormone in the body then TSH will decrease as a way of telling the thyroid to produce less hormone. TSH is the most common lab test performed by doctors to measure thyroid function. However, too many health providers rely on this test as the only measure of thyroid function, and this can be very misleading. The TSH lab result can be in the labs normal range and a person can still have altered thyroid function as determined by other thyroid lab tests. This overreliance on TSH as a primary indicator of thyroid function has resulted in millions of people not getting properly diagnosed with a real thyroid problem. A more comprehensive testing of thyroid function should be performed to have greater confidence that the thyroid gland is truly working at an optimal level . . . especially when a person is struggling with several symptoms of poor thyroid function. The thyroid has the nickname of the “great mimicker” because poor thyroid function can cause many symptoms and mimic many other health conditions. Some people go from one doctor to another trying to find out what is causing their symptoms . . . only to find out that their poor thyroid function is playing a major role in their health problems. Symptoms of underactive or hypo-thyroid function can include: fatigue, weight gain, soreness in muscles and joints, headaches, depression, constipation, slow metabolism, hair falling out, dry skin, intolerance to cold, menstrual changes in women, and more. Symptoms of overactive or hyper-thyroid function can include: sudden weight loss, anxiety and nervousness, rapid heartbeat, hands and fingers trembling, increased sweating, enlarged thyroid gland / swelling of the neck, difficulty sleeping, and more. Because poor thyroid function can affect many metabolic functions within the body, and can alter many lab results (not just the ones testing thyroid directly) . . . improving thyroid function becomes a higher priority when it’s discovered that it’s not functioning at an optimal level. When the TSH is in the Clinical High range this will indicate an underactive or hypo-thyroid function. It will help to compare this with other thyroid lab tests to confirm hypothyroidism. Many thyroid conditions involve an autoimmune reaction in which your immune system is attacking the thyroid gland or some aspect of thyroid function, so it will be helpful to also do thyroid antibody testing as this may change your dietary or therapeutic nutritional recommendations if your thyroid problems are in part due to an autoimmune condition. Other factors that can contribute to TSH in the Clinical High range may include: 1) a liver problem as the liver is highly involved in converting thyroid hormone into its most biologically active form called T3, 2) a pituitary problem as the pituitary produces TSH to control the thyroid gland, 3) a hypothalamus problem as the hypothalamus controls the pituitary and this is really the beginning of the hormonal communication within the body, 4) other hormone imbalance such as excess estrogen (estrogen dominance) affecting thyroid function, 5) chemicals or toxic heavy metals in the body disrupting thyroid function, 6) nutrient deficiencies such as iodine and selenium that can affect thyroid function, and 7) the effect of some medications - including taking a taking a thyroid medication dose that is too low for your body if on thyroid medication."

      description: "Your result for this test is in the Clinical Low range. White blood cells, also called leukocytes, are cells that exist in the blood, the lymphatic system, and tissues and are an important part of the body's defense system. They help protect against infections and also have a role in inflammation, and allergic reactions. The white blood cell (WBC) count totals the number of white blood cells in a sample of your blood. It is one test among several that is included in a complete blood count (CBC), which is often used in the general evaluation of your health.

      Blood is made up of three main types of cells suspended in fluid called plasma. In addition to WBCs, there are red blood cells and platelets. All of these cells are made in the bone marrow and are released into the blood to circulate.

      There are five types of WBCs, and each has a different function:

      • Three types of WBCs are referred to as granulocytes because of the granules present in their cytoplasm. These granules release chemicals and other substances as part of the immune response. Granulocytes include:
      • Neutrophils (neu) normally make up the largest number of circulating WBCs. They move into an area of damaged or infected tissue, where they engulf and destroy bacteria or sometimes fungi.
      • Eosinophils (eos) respond to infections caused by parasites, play a role in allergic reactions (hypersensitivities), and control the extent of immune responses and inflammation.
      • Basophils (baso) usually make up the fewest number of circulating WBCs and are thought to be involved in allergic reactions.
      • Lymphocytes (lymphs) exist in both the blood and the lymphatic system. They are divided into three types:
      • B lymphocytes (B cells) produce antibodies as part of the body’s natural defense (immune) responses.
      • T lymphocytes (T cells) recognize foreign substances and process them for removal.
      • Natural killer cells (NK cells) directly attack and kill abnormal cells such as cancer cells or those infected with a virus.
      • Monocytes (mono), similar to neutrophils, move to an area of infection and engulf and destroy bacteria. They are associated more often with chronic rather than acute infections.

      When there is an infection or an inflammatory process somewhere in the body, the bone marrow produces more WBCs, releasing them into the blood, and through a complex process, they move to the site of infection or inflammation. As the condition resolves, the production of WBCs by the bone marrow subsides and the number of WBCs drops to normal levels again.
      In addition to infections and inflammation, there are a number of conditions that can affect the production of WBCs by the bone marrow or the survival of WBCs in the blood, such as cancer or an immune disorder, resulting in either increased or decreased numbers of WBCs in the blood. The WBC count, along with the other components of the CBC, alerts a healthcare practitioner to possible health issues. Results are often interpreted in conjunction with additional tests, such as a WBC differential and a blood smear review. A differential may provide information on which type of WBC may be low or high, and a blood smear may show the presence of abnormal and/or immature WBCs."

RBCs also help transport a small portion of carbon dioxide, a waste product of cell metabolism, from those tissues and organs back to the lungs, where it is expelled. The typical lifespan of an RBC is 120 days. Thus the bone marrow must continually produce new RBCs to replace those that age and degrade or are lost through bleeding.

Other disorders may affect the lifespan of RBCs in circulation, especially if the RBCs are deformed due to an inherited or acquired defect or abnormality. These conditions may lead to a rise or drop in the RBC count. Changes in the RBC count usually mirror changes in other RBC tests, including the hematocrit and hemoglobin level. •  If RBCs are lost or destroyed faster than they can be replaced, if bone marrow production is disrupted, or if the RBCs produced do not function normally, or do not contain enough hemoglobin, then you may develop anemia, which affects the amount of oxygen reaching tissues. •  If too many RBCs are produced and released, then you can develop polycythemia. This can cause thicker blood, decreased blood flow and related problems, such as headache, dizziness, problems with vision, and even excessive clotting or heart attack."

      description: "Your result for this test is in the Functional High range. Red blood cells (RBCs), also called erythrocytes, are cells that circulate in the blood and carry oxygen throughout the body. The RBC count totals the number of red blood cells that are present in your sample of blood. It is one test among several that is included in a complete blood count (CBC) and is often used in the general evaluation of a person's health. Blood is made up of a few different types of cells suspended in fluid called plasma. In addition to RBCs, there are white blood cells (WBCs) and platelets. These cells are produced in the bone marrow and are released into the bloodstream as they mature. RBCs typically make up about 40% of the blood volume. RBCs contain hemoglobin, a protein that binds to oxygen and enables RBCs to carry oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and organs of the body. RBCs also help transport a small portion of carbon dioxide, a waste product of cell metabolism, from those tissues and organs back to the lungs, where it is expelled. The typical lifespan of an RBC is 120 days. Thus the bone marrow must continually produce new RBCs to replace those that age and degrade or are lost through bleeding. A number of conditions can affect RBC production and some conditions may result in significant bleeding. Other disorders may affect the lifespan of RBCs in circulation, especially if the RBCs are deformed due to an inherited or acquired defect or abnormality. These conditions may lead to a rise or drop in the RBC count. Changes in the RBC count usually mirror changes in other RBC tests, including the hematocrit and hemoglobin level. • If RBCs are lost or destroyed faster than they can be replaced, if bone marrow production is disrupted, or if the RBCs produced do not function normally, or do not contain enough hemoglobin, then you may develop anemia, which affects the amount of oxygen reaching tissues. •  If too many RBCs are produced and released, then you can develop polycythemia. This can cause thicker blood, decreased blood flow and related problems, such as headache, dizziness, problems with vision, and even excessive clotting or heart attack."

Hemoglobin is a protein that contains iron, and this is what gives your blood its red color.

When Hemoglobin is in the Clinical Low range we will first conclude that some type of Anemia is taking place. Anemia can happen for many reason to include: 1) loss of blood due to bleeding from some type of trauma or injury, a bleeding processing within the digestive system such as an ulcer or colon cancer, a severe bladder or kidney infection resulting in blood loss through the urine, or heavy menstrual bleeding in women, 2) a deficiency of one or more nutrients that are critical for healthy Red Blood Cells such as Iron, Vitamin B12, Vitamin B6, Folic Acid and the mineral Copper, 3) the Red Blood Cells are getting destroyed due to some type of auto-immune condition or other disease process, 4) some type of damage or disease process within the bone marrow resulting in decreased RBC production, 5) some type of damage or disease process of the kidneys resulting less production of erythropoietin - a hormone produced by the kidneys that stimulates the stem cells in the bone marrow to produce Red Blood Cells, 6) a possible liver problem, or 7) the effect of some medications.

If other lab tests are confirming some type of anemia than the elevated MCV would be indicating an anemia due to folic Acid or Vitamin B12 deficiency, and both of these B vitamins can be tested for directly in standard blood lab testing. Additional testing to confirm if the anemia is due to a Vitamin B12 deficiency can be done by doing a lab test for Methylmalonic Acid . . . with elevated levels of Methylmalonic Acid being a sensitive indicator of a Vitamin B12 deficiency. Another consideration when looking at Vitamin B12 deficiency is if there is enough Intrinsic Factor - a special protein produced by the stomach that allows you to properly absorb Vitamin B12 in the small intestine. This type of anemia in which there is too little Intrinsic Factor is called Pernicious Anemia, and can happen when the stomach is not producing enough Intrinsic Factor or with an auto-immune condition in which the immune system is attacking and destroying the Intrinsic Factor. Other reasons for a higher than optimal MCV can include: 1) Poor health or function of the stomach or small intestine or low stomach acid production, 2) a liver problem, 3) underactive or hypo-thyroid function, 4) a Vitamin C deficiency, 5) recent blood loss which will have the bone marrow increase production of new Red Blood Cells which are usually larger in size when first released into your blood, or 6) the effect of some medications."

    description:"Your result for this lab test is in the FUNCTIONAL HIGH range. RDW refers to Red Blood Cell Distribution Width, and this test measures if there is an abnormal variation in the size or width of your Red Blood Cells in a blood sample. Your Red Blood Cells are normally a little larger in size when they are first created in the bone marrow and released into your blood stream. As these cells mature they decrease slightly in size and remain that way for the life of that cell - which is about 120 days. This means that your bone marrow should be constantly producing new Red Blood Cells to replace the ones that die and are removed from your blood. Therefore, in the same blood sample we expect to see a certain variation in the width of your Red Blood Cells as new ones are replacing old ones. If something is affecting the health of your Red Blood Cells and hemoglobin, and your body is sensing that not enough oxygen is getting transported to all the cells of your body, your bone marrow will then produce and release more new Red Blood Cells into your blood as a way to get more oxygen transported to your cells. This increases the ratio of the slightly larger new Red Blood Cells versus the slightly smaller more mature Red Blood Cells. This change in the variation of Red Blood Cells size is seen as an increase in the RDW, and is most often seen with some type of anemia. The RDW is only a relevant test for those people that have anemia, and is not a helpful measurement for those that do not have anemia. When RDW is in the Functional High range we will first need to review other lab tests related to the health of your Red Blood Cells to determine if there is some type of anemia. If anemia exists with a Functional High RDW then we will consider: 1) iron deficiency anemia combined with a second type of anemia, 2) anemia due to Folic Acid deficiency, 3) anemia due to Vitamin B12 deficiency, and 4) other causes of anemia as indicated by other lab tests."

  description: "Your result for this lab test is in the CLINICAL LOW range. Serum Iron is the most basic measure of iron status in your body, and like the name implies it measures the amount of iron that is currently available in your blood. Iron is transported in your blood with the help of a carrier protein called Transferrin. Serum Iron is specifically measuring the amount of Iron circulating in your blood while it is bound to Transferrin. Iron is absorbed into the body from the foods we eat, and requires good digestion. The carrier protein - called Transferrin - is produced by the Liver, so good iron levels can depend on good liver function. Iron is also an important component of Hemoglobin which is found in your Red Blood Cells, and Hemoglobin has the important job of transporting oxygen to all the cells of your body to keep your cells healthy and functioning their best. About 70% of iron in your body is incorporated into Hemoglobin inside your Red Blood Cells. The remainder is found in tissues in its storage form called Ferritin. When Serum Iron is in the Functional High range we must first determine if there is truly an excess of iron in the body by also looking at other iron-related lab tests. Factors that can contribute to iron excess in the body include: 1) excess intake from iron containing supplements, drinking water with high levels of iron and use of iron cookware, 2) a liver problem, 3) an inflammatory process within the body, or 4) poor conversion of iron into hemoglobin due to some other nutrient deficiency - such as B6, B12 or Folic Acid."

  description: "Your result for this lab test is in the CLINICAL LOW range. Here is a summary of the Function, Deficiency Symptoms and Repletion information for Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin). Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) Function: Vitamin B12 is needed to form blood and immune cells, and support a healthy nervous system. A series of closely-related compounds known collectively as cobalamins or vitamin B12 are converted into active forms methylcobalamin or 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin. Methylcobalamin interacts with folate metabolism, preventing folate derivatives from being trapped in unusable states. Adenosylcobalamin is involved in the metabolism of odd-chain fatty acids and branched-chain amino acids. Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) Deficiency Symptoms: Deficiency symptoms of vitamin B12 are both hematological (pernicious anemia) and neurological. A megaloblastic anemia may occur because the effects of the vitamin B12 deficiency on folate metabolism. Shortness of breath, fatigue, weakness, irritability, sore tongue, and a decrease in blood cell counts (red, white and platelets) are all clinical signs of a vitamin B12 deficiency. Neurological symptoms are manifested as a progressive neuropathy, with loss of position sense and ataxia. If vitamin B12 repletion is not initiated, permanent neurological damage, including degeneration of nerves and spinal cord can result. Recent evidence suggests that mental symptoms of depression and fatigue are detectable before anemia develops. Vitamin B12 is necessary to prevent accumulation of homocysteine, a toxic metabolic byproduct linked to cardiovascular disease and connective tissue abnormalities. Hypochlorhydria and gastrointestinal disturbances are frequently associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) Repletion information: Dietary sources for cobalamins are strictly from animal foodstuffs. Vitamin B12 is not found in plant foodstuffs. Dietary supplements can also contain vitamin B12. The 1989 RDA for vitamin B12 is 2.0 ?g for adults. No toxic effects of oral vitamin B12 intake have been demonstrated, even in doses over 1000 ?g daily. Some people may require more frequent or larger doses than usual before repletion occurs."
